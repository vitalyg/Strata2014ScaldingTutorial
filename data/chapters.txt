1	 I       ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;      but when past joking he fell sick,      he really forced one to admire him --      and never played a shrewder trick.      Let others learn from his example!      But God, how deadly dull to sample      sickroom attendance night and day      and never stir a foot away!      And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,      of entertaining the half-dead:      one smoothes the pillows down in bed,      and glumly serves the medicine bottle,      and sighs, and asks oneself all through:      "When will the devil come for you?"''      {35}          II       Such were a young rake's meditations --      by will of Zeus, the high and just,      the legatee of his relations --      as horses whirled him through the dust.      Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,      without preliminary feeler      let me acquaint you on the nail      with this the hero of my tale:      Onegin, my good friend, was littered      and bred upon the Neva's brink,      where you were born as well, I think,      reader, or where you've shone and glittered!      There once I too strolled back and forth:      but I'm allergic to the North...1          III       After a fine career, his father      had only debts on which to live.      He gave three balls a year, and rather      promptly had nothing left to give.      Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:      at first Madame gave him tuition,      from her Monsieur took on the child.      He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.      Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,      reluctant to exhaust the boy,      treated his lessons as a ploy.      No moralizing from this joker;      a mild rebuke was his worst mark,      and then a stroll in Letny Park.      {36}          IV       But when the hour of youthful passion      struck for Evgeny, with its play      of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,      it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.      Eugene was free, and as a dresser      made London's dandy his professor.      His hair was fashionably curled,      and now at last he saw the World.      In French Onegin had perfected      proficiency to speak and write,      in the mazurka he was light,      his bow was wholly unaffected.      The World found this enough to treat      Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.          V       We all meandered through our schooling      haphazard; so, to God be thanks,      it's easy, without too much fooling,      to pass for cultured in our ranks.      Onegin was assessed by many      (critical judges, strict as any)      as well-read, though of pedant cast.      Unforced, as conversation passed,      he had the talent of saluting      felicitously every theme,      of listening like a judge-supreme      while serious topics were disputing,      or, with an epigram-surprise,      of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.      {37}          VI       Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;      yet, truthfully and not in chaff,      Onegin knew enough to savour      the meaning of an epigraph,      make Juvenal his text, or better      add vale when he signed a letter;      stumblingly call to mind he did      two verses of the Aeneid.      He lacked the slightest predilection      for raking up historic dust      or stirring annalistic must;      but groomed an anecdote-collection      that stretched from Romulus in his prime      across the years to our own time.          VII       He was without that dithyrambic      frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,      and telling trochee from iambic      was quite beyond his wit, we found.      He cursed Theocritus and Homer,      in Adam Smith was his diploma;      our deep economist had got      the gift of recognizing what      a nation's wealth is, what augments it,      and how a country lives, and why      it needs no gold if a supply      of simple product supplements it.      His father failed to understand      and took a mortgage on his land.      {38}          VIII       Evgeny's total store of knowledge      I have no leisure to recall;      where he was master of his college,      the art he'd studied best of all,      his young heyday's supreme employment,      its work, its torture, its enjoyment,      what occupied his chafing powers      throughout the boredom of the hours --      this was the science of that passion      which Ovid sang, for which the bard,      condemned to a lifetime of hard,      ended his wild career of fashion      deep in Moldavia the abhorred,      far, far from Italy, his adored.          (IX,2) X       How early he'd learnt to dissemble,      to hide a hope, to make a show      of jealousy, to seem to tremble      or pine, persuade of yes or no,      and act the humble or imperious,      the indifferent, or the deadly serious!      In languid silence, or the flame      of eloquence, and just the same      in casual letters of confession --      one thing inspired his breath, his heart,      and self-oblivion was his art!      How soft his glance, or at discretion      how bold or bashful there, and here      how brilliant with its instant tear!      {39}          XI       How well he donned new shapes and sizes --      startling the ingenuous with a jest,      frightening with all despair's disguises,      amusing, flattering with the best,      stalking the momentary weakness,      with passion and with shrewd obliqueness      swaying the artless, waiting on      for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!      then he'd implore a declaration,      and listen for the heart's first sound,      pursue his love -- and at one bound      secure a secret assignation,      then afterwards, alone, at ease,      impart such lessons as you please!          XII       How early on he learnt to trouble      the heart of the professional flirt!      When out to burst a rival's bubble,      how well he knew the way to hurt --      what traps he'd set him, with what malice      he'd pop the poison in his chalice!      But you, blest husbands, to the end      you kept your friendship with our friend:      the subtle spouse was just as loyal --      Faublas'3 disciple for an age --      as was the old suspicious sage,      and the majestic, antlered royal,      always contented with his life,      and with his dinner, and his wife.      {40}          (XIII, XIV,) XV       Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,      when little notes come on a tray.      What? Invitations? Yes, three houses      have each asked him to a soirée:      a ball here, there a children's party;      where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?      Which one comes first? It's just the same      to do them all is easy game.      Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling      complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,      Eugene attends the boulevard,      and there at large he goes patrolling      until Bréguet's unsleeping chime      advises him of dinner-time.          XVI       He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:      ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;      his collar in its beaver braiding      glitters with hoar-frost all about.      He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating      that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;      he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,      wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;      before him roast beef, red and gory,      and truffles, which have ever been      youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:      and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory,      sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese      and ananas, the gold of trees.      {41}          XVII       More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming      fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,      when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming      the new ballet he should be at.      He's off -- this ruthless legislator      for the footlights, this fickle traitor      to all the most adored actrices,      this denizen of the coulisses      that world where every man's a critic      who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff      at Cleopatra, hiss her off,      boo Phaedra out as paralytic,      encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice      to know the audience hears his voice.          XVIII       Enchanted land! There like a lampion      that king of the satiric scene,      Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,      and the derivative Knyazhnín:8      there сzerov8 shared the unwilling      tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,      with young Semyónova,9 and there      our friend Katénin8 brought to bear      once more Corneille's majestic story;      there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in      with comedies of swarm and din;      there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:      there, where the coulisse entrance went,      that's where my years of youth were spent.      {42}          XIX       My goddesses! Where are you banished?      lend ears to my lugubrious tone:      have other maidens, since you vanished,      taken your place, though not your throne?      your chorus, is it dead for ever?      Russia's Terpsichore, shall never      again I see your soulful flight?      shall my sad gaze no more alight      on features known, but to that dreary,      that alien scene must I now turn      my disillusioned glass, and yearn,      bored with hilarity, and weary,      and yawn in silence at the stage      as I recall a bygone age?          XX       The house is packed out; scintillating,      the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;      the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --      and up the rustling curtain crawls.      Then with a half-ethereal splendour,      bound where the magic bow will send her,      Istómina,11 thronged all around      by Naiads, one foot on the ground,      twirls the other slowly as she pleases,      then suddenly she's off, and there      she's up and flying through the air      like fluff before Aeolian breezes;      she'll spin this way and that, and beat      against each other swift, small feet.      {43}          XXI       Applause. Onegin enters -- passes      across the public's toes; he steers      straight to his stall, then turns his glasses      on unknown ladies in the tiers;      he's viewed the boxes without passion,      he's seen it all; with looks and fashion      he's dreadfully dissatisfied;      to gentlemen on every side      he's bowed politely; his attention      wanders in a distracted way      across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --      they all have richly earned a pension;''      he turns away: ``I've had enough --      now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''          XXII       Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid      on stage are thumping without cease;      Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,      the footmen sleep on the pelisses;      the audience still is busy stamping,      still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;      still everywhere the lamps are bright;      outside and in they star the night;      still shivering in the bitter weather      the horses fidget worse and worse;      the coachmen ring the fire, and curse      their lords, and thwack their palms together;      but Eugene's out from din and press:      by now he's driving home to dress.      {44}          XXIII       Shall I depict with expert knowledge      the cabinet behind the door      where the prize-boy of fashion's college      is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?      Whatever for caprice of spending      ingenious London has been sending      across the Baltic in exchange      for wood and tallow; all the range      of useful objects that the curious      Parisian taste invents for one --      for friends of languor, or of fun,      or for the modishly luxurious --      all this, at eighteen years of age,      adorned the sanctum of our sage.          XXIV       Porcelain and bronzes on the table,      with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12      such crystalled scents as best are able      to drive the swooning senses mad;      with combs, and steel utensils serving      as files, and scissors straight and curving,      brushes on thirty different scales;      brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.      Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)      could not conceive how solemn Grimm13      dared clean his nails in front of him,      the brilliant crackpot: this reaction      shows freedom's advocate, that strong      champion of rights, as in the wrong.      {45}          XXV       A man who's active and incisive      can yet keep nail-care much in mind:      why fight what's known to be decisive?      custom is despot of mankind.      Dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading      the barbs that envy's always spreading,      Eugene's a pedant in his dress,      in fact a thorough fop, no less.      Three whole hours, at the least accounting,      he'll spend before the looking-glass,      then from his cabinet he'll pass      giddy as Venus when she's mounting      a masculine disguise to aid      her progress at the masquerade.          XXVI       Your curiosity is burning      to hear what latest modes require,      and so, before the world of learning,      I could describe here his attire;      and though to do so would be daring,      it's my profession; he was wearing --      but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,      these words are not of Russian stock:      I know (and seek your exculpation)      that even so my wretched style      already tends too much to smile      on words of foreign derivation,      though years ago I used to look      at the Academic Diction-book.      {46}          XXVII       That isn't our immediate worry:      we'd better hasten to the ball,      where, in a cab, and furious hurry,      Onegin has outrun us all.      Along the fronts of darkened houses,      along the street where slumber drowses,      twin lamps of serried coupés throw      a cheerful glimmer on the snow      and radiate a rainbow: blazing      with lampions studded all about      the sumptuous palais shines out;      shadows that flit behind the glazing      project in silhouette the tops      of ladies and of freakish fops.          XXVIII       Up to the porch our hero's driven:      in, past concierge, up marble stair      flown like an arrow, then he's given      a deft arrangement to his hair,      and entered. Ballroom overflowing...      and band already tired of blowing,      while a mazurka holds the crowd;      and everything is cramped and loud;      spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,      dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,      and on their captivating trail      incendiary looks are slinking,      while roar of violins contrives      to drown the hiss of modish wives.      {47}          XXIX       In days of carefree aspirations,      the ballroom drove me off my head:      the safest place for declarations,      and where most surely notes are sped.      You husbands, deeply I respect you!      I'm at your service to protect you;      now pay attention, I beseech,      and take due warning from my speech.      You too, mamas, I pray attend it,      and watch your daughters closer yet,      yes, focus on them your lorgnette,      or else... or else, may God forfend it!      I only write like this, you know,      since I stopped sinning years ago.          XXX       Alas, on pleasure's wild variety      I've wasted too much life away!      But, did they not corrupt society,      I'd still like dances to this day:      the atmosphere of youth and madness,      the crush, the glitter and the gladness,      the ladies' calculated dress;      I love their feet -- though I confess      that all of Russia can't contribute      three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there      exists for me one special pair!      one pair! I pay them memory's tribute      though cold I am and sad; in sleep      the heartache that they bring lies deep.      {48}          XXXI       Oh, when, and to what desert banished,      madman, can you forget their print?      my little feet, where have you vanished,      what flowers of spring display your dint?      Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,      across our snows of northern bleakness      you left no steps that could be tracked:      you loved the opulent contact      of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.      Was it for you that I became      long since unstirred by praise and fame      and fatherland and grim confinement?      The happiness of youth is dead,      just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.          XXXII       Diana's breast, the cheeks of Flora,      all these are charming! but to put      it frankly, I'm a firm adorer      of the Terpsichorean foot.      It fascinates by its assurance      of recompense beyond endurance,      and fastens, like a term of art,      the wilful fancies of the heart.      My love for it is just as tender,      under the table's linen shield,      on springtime grasses of the field,      in winter, on the cast-iron fender,      on ballroom's looking-glass parquet      or on the granite of the bay.      {49}          XXXIII       On the seashore, with storm impending,      how envious was I of the waves      each in tumultuous turn descending      to lie down at her feet like slaves!      I longed, like every breaker hissing,      to smother her dear feet with kissing.      No, never in the hottest fire      of boiling youth did I desire      with any torture so exquisite      to kiss Armida's lips, or seek      the flaming roses of a cheek,      or languid bosoms; and no visit      of raging passion's surge and roll      ever so roughly rocked my soul!          XXXIV       Another page of recollection:      sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,      I grasp a stirrup with affection,      I feel a small foot in my hand;      fancies once more are hotly bubbling,      once more that touch is fiercely troubling      the blood within my withered heart,      once more the love, once more the smart...      But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,      enough of my loquacious lyre:      they don't deserve what they inspire      in terms of poetry or passion --      their looks and language in deceit      are just as nimble as their feet.      {50}          XXXV       And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,      from ball to bed behold him come;      while Petersburg's already rousing,      untirable, at sound of drum:      the merchant's up, the cabman's walking      towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;      see with their jugs the milk-girls go      and crisply crunch the morning snow.      The city's early sounds awake her;      shutters are opened and the soft      blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,      and more than once the German baker,      punctilious in his cotton cap,      has opened up his serving-trap.          XXXVI       Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,      converting morning to midnight,      he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,      this child of luxury and delight.      Then, after midday he'll be waking;      his life till dawn's already making,      always monotonously gay,      tomorrow just like yesterday.      But was it happy, his employment,      his freedom, in his youth's first flower,      with brilliant conquests by the shower,      and every day its own enjoyment?      Was it to no effect that he,      at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?      {51}          XXXVII       No, early on his heart was cooling      and he was bored with social noise;      no, not for long were belles the ruling      objective of his thoughts and joys:      soon, infidelity proved cloying,      and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;      not every day could he wash down      his beefsteak with champagne, or drown      his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,      full of his usual pith and wit,      with cranium aching fit to split;      and though he liked a fiery quarrel --      yet he fell out of love at last      with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.          XXXVIII       The illness with which he'd been smitten      should have been analysed when caught,      something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,      or Russia's chondria, for short;      it mastered him in slow gradation;      thank God, he had no inclination      to blow his brains out, but in stead      to life grew colder than the dead.      So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,      he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote      from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;      no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,      no, nothing caused his heart to stir,      and nothing pierced his senses' blur.      {52}          (XXXIX, XL, XLI,) XLII       Capricious belles of grand Society!      you were the first ones he forswore;      for in our time, beyond dubiety,      the highest circles are a bore.      It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,      some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,      but by and large their talk's a hash      of the most harmless, hopeless trash.      And what's more, they're so supercilious,      so pure, so spotless through and through,      so pious, and so clever too,      so circumspect, and so punctilious,      so virtuous that, no sooner seen,      at once they give a man the spleen.          XLIII       You too, prime beauties in your flower      who late at night are whirled away      by drozhkies jaunting at full power      over the Petersburg pavé --      he ended even your employment;      and in retreat from all enjoyment      locked himself up inside his den      and with a yawn took up his pen,      and tried to write, but a hard session      of work made him feel sick, and still      no word came flowing from his quill;      he failed to join that sharp profession      which I myself won't praise or blame      since I'm a member of the same.      {53}          XLIV       Idle again by dedication,      oppressed by emptiness of soul,      he strove to achieve the appropriation      of other's thought -- a splendid goal;      with shelves of books deployed for action,      he read, and read -- no satisfaction:      here's boredom, madness or pretence,      here there's no conscience, here no sense;      they're all chained up in different fetters,      the ancients have gone stiff and cold,      the moderns rage against the old.      He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,      and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack      in taffeta of mourning black.          XLV       Escaped from social rhyme and reason,      retired, as he, from fashion's stream,      I was Onegin's friend that season.      I liked his quality, the dream      which held him silently subjected,      his strangeness, wholly unaffected,      his mind, so cold and so precise.      The bitterness was mine -- the ice      was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:      our lives were flat, and what had fired      both hearts to blaze had now expired;      there waited for us both the malice      of blind Fortuna and of men      in lives that were just dawning then.      {54}          XLVI       He who has lived and thought is certain      to scorn the men with whom he deals;      days that are lost behind the curtain,      ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --      for him all sham has found rejection,      he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,      and by Repentance. All this lends,      on most occasions between friends,      a great attraction to conversing.      At first Onegin's tongue produced      a haze in me, but I grew used      to his disputing and his cursing;      his virulence that made you smile,      his epigrams topped up with bile.          XLVII       How often, when the sky was glowing,      by Neva, on a summer night,      and when its waters were not showing,      in their gay glass, the borrowed light      of Dian's visage, in our fancies      recalling earlier time's romances,      recalling earlier loves, did we,      now sensitive, and now carefree,      drink in the midnight benediction,      the silence when our talk had ceased!      Like convicts in a dream released      from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction      we were swept off, in reverie's haze,      to the beginning of our days.      {55}          XLVIII       Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,      and leant upon the granite shelf;      he stood there, pensive and forgetful,      just as the Poet15 paints himself.      Silence was everywhere enthralling;      just sentries to each other calling,      and then a drozhky's clopping sound      from Million Street16 came floating round;      and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,      swam on the river's dreaming face,      and then, with an enchanting grace,      came distant horns, and gallant singing.      Yet sweeter far, at such a time,      the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!          XLIX       O Adrian waves, my invocation;      O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;      hear, once more filled with inspiration,      the magic voices of your stream,      sacred to children of Apollo!      Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,      through it they're known to me, and kin.      Italian nights, when I'll drink in      your molten gold, your charmed infusion;      with a Venetian maiden who      can chatter, and be silent too,      I'll float in gondola's seclusion;      from her my lips will learn and mark      the tongue of love and of Petrarch.      {56}          L       When comes my moment to untether?      ``it's time!'' and freedom hears my hail.      I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,      I signal to each passing sail.      Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,      battling along that watery freeway,      when shall I start on my escape?      It's time to drop astern the shape      of the dull shores of my disfavour,      and there, beneath your noonday sky,      my Africa,18 where waves break high,      to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,      land where I learned to love and weep,      land where my heart is buried deep.          LI       Eugene would willingly have started      with me to see an alien strand;      but soon the ways we trod were parted      for quite a while by fortune's hand.      His father died; and (as expected)      before Onegin there collected      the usurers' voracious tribe.      To private tastes we each subscribe:      Evgeny, hating litigation,      and satisfied with what he'd got,      made over to them his whole lot,      finding in that no deprivation --      or else, from far off, he could see      old Uncle's end was soon to be.      {57}          LII       In fact one day a note came flying      from the agent, with this tale to tell:      Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,      wished him to come and say farewell.      Evgeny read the sad epistle      and set off prompter than a whistle      as fast as post-horses could go,      already yawned before the show,      exercised, under lucre's banner,      in sighs and boredom and deceits      (my tale's beginning here repeats);      but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,      a corpse on boards was all he found,      an offering ready for the ground.          LIII       The yard was bursting with dependants;      there gathered at the coffin-side      friends, foes, priests, guests, inured attendants      of every funeral far and wide;      they buried Uncle, congregated      to eat and drink, then separated      with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,      as if some goal had been achieved.      Eugene turned countryman. He tasted      the total ownership of woods,      mills, lands and waters -- he whose goods      till then had been dispersed and wasted --      and glad he was he'd thus arranged      for his old courses to be changed.      {58}          LIV       It all seemed new -- for two days only --      the coolness of the sombre glade,      the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,      the murmur where the streamlet played...      the third day, wood and hill and grazing      gripped him no more; soon they were raising      an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,      he saw that, as in cities, here      boredom has just as sure an entry,      although there are no streets, no cards,      no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.      Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,      and dutifully shared his life      just like a shadow, or a wife.          LV       No, I was born for peace abounding      and country stillness: there the lyre      has voices that are more resounding,      poetic dreams, a brighter fire.      To harmless idleness devoted,      on waves of far niente floated,      I roam by the secluded lake.      And every morning I awake      to freedom, softness and enjoyment:      sleep much, read little, and put down      the thought of volatile renown.      Was it not in such sweet employment      such shadowy and leisured ways,      that once I spent my happiest days?      {59}          LVI       O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,      o fields -- to you I'm vowed at heart.      I regularly take much pleasure      in showing how to tell apart      myself and Eugene, lest a reader      of mocking turn, or else a breeder      of calculated slander should,      spying my features, as he could,      put back the libel on the table      that, like proud Byron, I can draw      self-portraits only -- furthermore      the charge that poets are unable      to sing of others must imply      the poet's only theme is ``I.''          LVII       Poets, I'll say in this connection,      adore the love that comes in dream.      In time past, objects of affection      peopled my sleep, and to their theme      my soul in secret gave survival;      then from the Muse there came revival:      my carefree song would thus reveal      the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,      and captive girls, by Salgir20 lying.      And now, my friends, I hear from you      a frequent question: ``tell me who      inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?      To whom do you, from all the train      of jealous girls, devote its strain?      {60}          LVIII       ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,      rewards the music of your mind      with fond caress? whose adoration      is in your poetry enshrined?''      No one's, I swear by God! in sadness      I suffered once from all the madness      of love's anxiety. Blessed is he      who can combine it with the free      fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled      poetry's sacred frenzy, made      a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed      the pangs with which his heart was troubled,      and, with it, forced renown to come --      but I, in love, was dull and dumb.          LIX       Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather      of mind got clarity new-found;      now free, I once more weave together      emotion, thought, and magic sound;      I write, my heart has ceased its pining,      my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,      beside unfinished lines, a suite      of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;      dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;      I'm grieving still, but no more tears,      and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears      will in my soul be hushed and dying.      That's when I'll sit down to compose      an ode in twenty-five cantos.      {61}          LX       I've drawn a plan and a projection,      the hero's name's decided too.      Meanwhile my novel's opening section      is finished, and I've looked it through      meticulously; in my fiction      there's far too much of contradiction,      but I refuse to chop or change.      The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:      I'll feed the journalists for dinner      fruits of my labour and my ink...      So now be off to Neva's brink,      you newborn work, and like a winner      earn for me the rewards of fame --      misunderstanding, noise, and blame!
2	 I       The place where Eugene loathed his leisure      was an enchanting country nook:      there any friend of harmless pleasure      would bless the form his fortune took.      The manor house, in deep seclusion,      screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,      looked on a river: far away      before it was the golden play      of light that flowering fields reflected:      villages flickered far and near,      and cattle roamed the plain, and here      a park, enormous and neglected,      spread out its shadow all around --      the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.      {63}          II       The château was of a construction      befitting such a noble pile:      it stood, defiant of destruction      in sensible old-fashioned style.      High ceilings everywhere abounded;      in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,      ancestral1 portraits met the view      and stoves with tiles of various hue.      All this has now gone out of fashion,      I don't know why, but for my friend      interior décor in the end      excited not a hint of passion:      a modish taste, a dowdy touch --      both set him yawning just as much.          III       The rustic sage, in that apartment,      forty years long would criticise      his housekeeper and her department      look through the pane, and squash the flies.      Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:      two cupboards, one divan, a table,      no trace of ink, no spots, no stains.      And of the cupboards, one contains      a book of household calculations,      the other, jugs of applejack,      fruit liqueurs and an Almanack      for 1808: his obligations      had left the squire no time to look      at any other sort of book.      {64}          IV       Alone amid all his possessions,      to pass the time was Eugene's theme:      it led him, in these early sessions,      to institute a new regime.      A thinker in a desert mission,      he changed the corvée of tradition      into a small quit-rent -- and got      his serfs rejoicing at their lot.      But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty      neighbour was sure, from this would flow      consequences of hideous woe;      another's grin was sly and shifty,      but all concurred that, truth to speak,      he was a menace, and a freak.          V       At first they called; but on perceiving      invariably, as time went on,      that from the backdoor he'd be leaving      on a fast stallion from the Don,      once on the highway he'd detected      the noise their rustic wheels projected --      they took offence at this, and broke      relations off, and never spoke.      ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,      he's a freemason too; for him,      red wine in tumblers to the brim --      but ladies' hands are not for kissing;      it's yes or no, but never sir.''      The vote was passed without demur.      {65}          VI       Meanwhile another new landowner      came driving to his country seat,      and, in the district, this persona      drew scrutiny no less complete --      Vladimir Lensky, whose creator      was Göttingen, his alma mater,      good-looking, in the flower of age,      a poet, and a Kantian sage.      He'd brought back all the fruits of learning      from German realms of mist and steam,      freedom's enthusiastic dream,      a spirit strange, a spirit burning,      an eloquence of fevered strength,      and raven curls of shoulder-length.          VII       He was too young to have been blighted      by the cold world's corrupt finesse;      his soul still blossomed out, and lighted      at a friend's word, a girl's caress.      In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,      he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;      the world's éclat, its thunder-roll,      still captivated his young soul.      He sweetened up with fancy's icing      the uncertainties within his heart;      for him, the objective on life's chart      was still mysterious and enticing --      something to rack his brains about,      suspecting wonders would come out.      {66}          VIII       He was convinced, a kindred creature      would be allied to him by fate;      that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,      from day to day she could but wait;      and he believed his friends were ready      to put on chains for him, and steady      their hand to grapple slander's cup,      in his defence, and smash it up;      < that there existed, for the indulgence      of human friendship, holy men,      immortals picked by fate for when,      with irresistible refulgence,      their breed would (some years after this)      shine out and bring the world to bliss. >2          IX       Compassion, yes, and indignation,      honest devotion to the good,      bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,      already stirred him as they should.      He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;      Schiller and Goethe had refined him,      and theirs was the poetic flame      that fired his soul, to burn the same;      the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,      fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;      but in his songs kept pride of place      for the sublime, and for the passions      of virgin fancy, and again      the charm of what was grave and plain.      {67}          X       He sang of love, to love subjected,      his song was limpid in its tune      as infant sleep, or the unaffected      thoughts of a girl, or as the moon      through heaven's expanse serenely flying,      that queen of secrets and of sighing.      He sang of grief and parting-time,      of something vague, some misty clime;      roses romantically blowing;      of many distant lands he sang      where in the heart of silence rang      his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;      he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --      when not quite eighteen years of age.          XI       But in that desert his attainments      only to Eugene showed their worth;      Lensky disliked the entertainments      of neighbouring owners of the earth --      he fled from their resounding chatter!      Their talk, so sound on every matter,      on liquor, and on hay brought in,      on kennels, and on kith and kin,      it had no sparkle of sensation,      it lacked, of course, poetic heart,      sharpness of wit, and social art,      and logic; yet the conversation      upon the side of the distaff --      that was less clever still by half.      {68}          XII       Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,      was asked around as quite a catch --      such is the usual country cooking;      and all the neighbours planned a match      between their girls and this half-Russian.      As soon as he appears, discussion      touches obliquely, but with speed,      on the dull life that bachelors lead;      and then it's tea that comes to mention,      and Dunya works the samovar;      and soon they bring her... a guitar      and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''      then, help me God, she caterwauls:      ``Come to me in my golden halls.''          XIII       Lensky of course was quite untainted      by any itch for marriage ties;      instead the chance to get acquainted      with Eugene proved a tempting prize.      So, verse and prose, they came together.      No ice and flame, no stormy weather      and granite, were so far apart.      At first, disparity of heart      rendered them tedious to each other;      then liking grew, then every day      they met on horseback; quickly they      became like brother knit to brother.      Friendship, as I must own to you,      blooms when there's nothing else to do.      {69}          XIV       But friendship, as between our heroes,      can't really be: for we've outgrown      old prejudice; all men are zeros,      the units are ourselves alone.      Napoleon's our sole inspiration;      the millions of two-legged creation      for us are instruments and tools;      feeling is quaint, and fit for fools.      More tolerant in his conception      than most. Evgeny, though he knew      and scorned his fellows through and through,      yet, as each rule has its exception,      people there were he glorified,      feelings he valued -- from outside.          XV       He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady      perfervid language of the bard,      his mind, in judgement still unsteady,      and always the inspired regard --      to Eugene all was new and thrilling;      he struggled to bite back the chilling      word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer      folly for me to interfere      with such a blissful, brief infection --      even without me it will sink;      but meanwhile let him live, and think      the universe is all perfection;      youth is a fever; we must spare      its natural right to rave and flare.      {70}          XVI       Between them, every topic started      reflection or provoked dispute:      treaties of nations long departed,      and good and ill, and learning's fruit,      the prejudices of the ages,      the secrets of the grave, the pages      of fate, and life, each in its turn      became their scrutiny's concern.      In the white heat of some dissension      the abstracted poet would bring forth      fragments of poems from the North,      which, listening with some condescension,      the tolerant Evgeny heard --      but scarcely understood a word.          XVII       But it was passion that preempted      the thoughts of my two anchorites.      From that rough spell at last exempted,      Onegin spoke about its flights      with sighs unconsciously regretful.      Happy is he who's known its fretful      empire, and fled it; happier still      is he who's never felt its will,      he who has cooled down love with parting,      and hate with malice; he whose life      is yawned away with friends and wife      untouched by envy's bitter smarting,      who on a deuce, that famous cheat,      has never staked his family seat.      {71}          XVIII       When we've retreated to the banner      of calm and reason, when the flame      of passion's out, and its whole manner      become a joke to us, its game,      its wayward tricks, its violent surging,      its echoes, its belated urging,      reduced to sense, not without pain --      we sometimes like to hear again      passion's rough language talked by others,      and feel once more emotion's ban.      So a disabled soldier-man,      retired, forgotten by his brothers,      in his small shack, will listen well      to tales that young moustachios tell.          XIX       But it's the talent for concealing      that ardent youth entirely lacks;      hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,      it blabs, and spills them in its tracks.      As, lovingly, in his confession,      the poet's heart found full expression,      Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,      and felt himself love's invalide.      Lensky ingenuously related      his conscience's record, and so      Onegin swiftly came to know      his tale of youthful love, narrated      with deep emotion through and through,      to us, though, not exactly new.      {72}          XX       Ah, he had loved a love that never      is known today; only a soul      that raves with poetry can ever      be doomed to feel it: there's one goal      perpetually, one goal for dreaming,      one customary object gleaming,      one customary grief each hour!      not separation's chilling power,      no years of absence past returning,      no beauties of a foreign clime,      no noise of gaiety, no time      devoted to the Muse, or learning,      nothing could alter or could tire      this soul that glowed with virgin fire.          XXI       Since earliest boyhood he had doted      on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,      with tenderness he'd watched and noted      her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,      by deep and shady woods protected;      the crown of marriage was projected      for them by fathers who, as friends      and neighbours, followed the same ends.      Away inside that unassuming      homestead, before her parents' gaze,      she blossomed in the graceful ways      of innocence: a lily blooming      in deepest grasses, quite alone,      to bee and butterfly unknown.      {73}          XXII       And our young poet -- Olga fired him      in his first dream of passion's fruit,      and thoughts of her were what inspired him      to the first meanings of his flute.      Farewell the games of golden childhood!      he fell in love with darkest wildwood,      solitude, stillness and the night,      the stars, the moon -- celestial light      to which so oft we've dedicated      those walks amid the gloom and calm      of evening, and those tears, the balm      of secret pain... but it's now rated      by judgement of the modern camp      almost as good as a dim lamp.          XXIII       Full of obedience and demureness,      as gay as morning and as clear,      poetic in her simple pureness,      sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,      in Olga everything expresses --      the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,      smile, voice and movements, little waist --      take any novel, clearly traced      you're sure to find her portrait in it:      a portrait with a charming touch;      once I too liked it very much;      but now it bores me every minute.      Reader, the elder sister now      must be my theme, if you'll allow.      {74}          XXIV       Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,      self-willed it may be just the same;      but it's the first time you'll have known it,      a novel graced with such a name.      What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,      and yet inseparably present,      I know it, in the thoughts of all      are old times, and the servants' hall.      We must confess that taste deserts us      even in our names (and how much worse      when we begin to talk of verse);      culture, so far from healing, hurts us;      what it's transported to our shore      is mincing manners -- nothing more.          XXV       So she was called Tatyana. Truly      she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked      the rosy bloom that glowed so newly      to catch the eye and to attract.      Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,      wild as a forest deer, and fearful,      Tatyana had a changeling look      in her own home. She never took      to kissing or caressing father      or mother; and in all the play      of children, though as young as they,      she never joined, or skipped, but rather      in silence all day she'd remain      ensconced beside the window-pane.      {75}          XXVI       Reflection was her friend and pleasure      right from the cradle of her days;      it touched with reverie her leisure,      adorning all its country ways.      Her tender touch had never fingered      the needle, never had she lingered      to liven with a silk atour      the linen stretched on the tambour.      Sign of the urge for domination:      in play with her obedient doll      the child prepares for protocol --      that corps of social legislation --      and to it, with a grave import,      repeats what her mama has taught.          XXVII       Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,      not even in her earliest age;      she'd never tell them news or scandal      or novelties from fashion's page.      Tatyana never knew the attraction      of childish pranks: a chilled reaction      to horror-stories told at night      in winter was her heart's delight.      Whenever nyanya had collected      for Olga, on the spreading lawn,      her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,      she'd never join the game selected,      for she was bored by laughs and noise      and by the sound of silly joys.      {76}          XXVIII       She loved the balcony, the session      of waiting for the dawn to blush,      when, in pale sky, the stars' procession      fades from the view, and in the hush      earth's rim grows light, and a forewarning      whisper of breeze announces morning,      and slowly day begins to climb.      In winter, when for longer time      the shades of night within their keeping      hold half the world still unreleased,      and when, by misty moon, the east      is softly, indolently sleeping,      wakened at the same hour of night      Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.          XXIX       From early on she loved romances,      they were her only food... and so      she fell in love with all the fancies      of Richardson and of Rousseau.      Her father, kindly, well-regarded,      but in an earlier age retarded,      could see no harm in books; himself      he never took one from the shelf,      thought them a pointless peccadillo;      and cared not what his daughter kept      by way of secret tome that slept      until the dawn beneath her pillow.      His wife, just like Tatyana, had      on Richardson gone raving mad.      {77}          XXX       And not because she'd read him, either,      and not because she'd once preferred      Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;      but in the old days she had heard      about them -- nineteen to the dozen --      so often from her Moscow cousin      Princess Alina. She was still      engaged then -- but against her will;      loved someone else, not her intended,      someone towards whose heart and mind      her feelings were far more inclined --      this Grandison of hers was splendid,      a fop, a punter on the cards,      and junior Ensign in the Guards.          XXXI       She was like him and always sported      the latest fashions of the town;      but, without asking, they transported      her to the altar and the crown.      The better to dispel her sorrow      her clever husband on the morrow      took her to his estate, where she,      at first, with God knows whom to see,      in tears and violent tossing vented      her grief, and nearly ran away.      Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,      she grew accustomed, and contented.      In stead of happiness, say I,      custom's bestowed us from on high.      {78}          XXXII       For it was custom that consoled her      in grief that nothing else could mend;      soon a great truth came to enfold her      and give her comfort to the end:      she found, in labours and in leisure,      the secret of her husband's measure,      and ruled him like an autocrat --      so all went smoothly after that.      Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,      fieldwork directed from the path,      accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;      meantime she'd give the maids a beating      if her cross mood was at its worst --      but never asked her husband first.          XXXIII       No, soon she changed her old demeanour:      girls' albums, signed in blood for choice;      Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';      conversing in a singsong voice;      lacing her stays up very tightly;      pronouncing through her nose politely      the Russian N, like N in French;      soon all that went without a wrench:      album and stays, Princess Alina,      sentiment, notebook, verses, all      she quite forgot -- began to call      ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,      and introduced, for the last lap,      a quilted chamber-robe and cap.      {79}          XXXIV       Her loving spouse with approbation      left her to follow her own line,      trusted her without hesitation,      and wore his dressing-gown to dine.      His life went sailing in calm weather;      sometimes the evening brought together      neighbours and friends in kindly group,      a plain, unceremonious troop,      for grumbling, gossiping and swearing      and for a chuckle or a smile.      The evening passes, and meanwhile      here's tea that Olga's been preparing;      after that, supper's served, and so      bed-time, and time for guests to go.          XXXV       Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,      sweet old tradition was preserved:      for them, in Butterweek5 the greaseful,      Russian pancakes were always served;      < ...      ... >2      they needed kvas like air; at table      their guests, for all they ate and drank,      were served in order of their rank.      {80}          XXXVI       And so they lived, two ageing mortals,      till he at last was summoned down      into the tomb's wide open portals,      and once again received a crown.      Just before dinner, from his labours      he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,      his children and his faithful wife,      far more than most who leave this life.      He was a good and simple barin;6      above the dust of his remains      the funeral monument explains:      ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,      beneath the stone reposes here,      servant of God, and Brigadier.''          XXXVII       Lensky, restored to his manorial      penates, came to cast an eye      over his neighbour's plain memorial,      and offer to that ash a sigh;      sadly he mourned for the departed.      ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:      ``he dandled me as a small boy.      How many times I made a toy      of his Ochákov7 decoration!      He destined Olga's hand for me,      kept asking: "shall I live to see"...''      so, full of heart-felt tribulation,      Lensky composed in autograph      a madrigal for epitaph.      {81}          XXXVIII       There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,      his parents' patriarchal dust      with lines to mark where they were sleeping...      Alas! the generations must,      as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,      reap a brief harvest on their furrows;      they rise and ripen and fall dead:      others will follow where they tread...      and thus our race, so fluctuating,      grows, surges, boils, for lack of room      presses its forebears to the tomb.      We too shall find our hour is waiting;      it will be our descendants who      out of this world will crowd us too.          XXXIX       So glut yourselves until you're sated      on this unstable life, my friends!      its nullity I've always hated,      I know too surely how it ends.      I'm blind to every apparition;      and yet a distant admonition      of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;      it would be painful to depart      and leave no faint footprint of glory...      I never lived or wrote for praise;      yet how I wish that I might raise      to high renown my doleful story,      that there be just one voice which came,      like a true friend, to speak my name.      {82}          XL       And someone's heart will feel a quiver,      for maybe fortune will have saved      from drowning's death in Lethe river      the strophe over which I slaved;      perhaps -- for flattering hope will linger --      some future dunce will point a finger      at my famed portrait and will say:      he was a poet in his day.      I thank him without reservation,      the peaceful Muses' devotee,      whose memory will preserve for me      the fleeting works of my creation,      whose kindly hand will ruffle down      the laurel in the old man's crown!
3	 ``You're off? why, there's a poet for you!''      ``Goodbye, Onegin, time I went.''      ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;      but where are all your evenings spent?''      ``At the Larins'!'' ``But how mysterious.      For goodness' sake, you can't be serious      killing each evening off like that?''      ``You're wrong.'' ``But what I wonder at      is this -- one sees from here the party:      in first place -- listen, am I right? --      a simple Russian family night:      the guests are feasted, good and hearty,      on jam, and speeches in regard      to rains, and flax, and the stockyard.''      {84}          II       ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''      ``Boredom, that's what so bad, my friend.''      ``Your modish world, I'll do without it;      give me the homely hearth, and lend...''      ``You pile one eclogue on another!      for God's sake, that will do. But, brother,      you're really going? Well, I'm sad.      Now, Lensky, would it be so bad      for me to glimpse this Phyllis ever      with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --      pen, tears, and rhymes, and all the rest?      Present me, please.'' ``You're joking.'' ``Never.''      ``Gladly.'' ``So when?'' ``Why not tonight?      They will receive us with delight.''          III       ``Let's go.'' The friends, all haste and vigour,      drive there, and with formality      are treated to the fullest rigour      of old-lime hospitality.      The protocol is all one wishes:      the jams appear in little dishes;      on a small table's oilcloth sheen      the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1      {85}          IV       And home was now their destination;      as by the shortest way they flew,      this was our heroes' conversation      secretly overheard by you.      ``You yawn, Onegin?'' ``As I'm used to.''      ``This time I think you've been reduced to      new depths of boredom.'' ``No, the same.      The fields are dark, since evening came.      Drive on, Andryushka! quicker, quicker!      the country's pretty stupid here!      oh, à propos: Larin's a dear      simple old lady; but the liquor --      I'm much afraid that bilberry wine      won't benefit these guts of mine.''          V       ``But tell me, which one was Tatyana?''      ``She was the one who looked as still      and melancholy as Svetlana,2      and sat down by the window-sill.''      ``The one you love's the younger daughter?''      ``Why not?'' ``I'd choose the other quarter      if I, like you, had been a bard.      Olga's no life in her regard:      the roundest face that you've set eyes on,      a pretty girl exactly like      any Madonna by Van Dyck:      a dumb moon, on a dumb horizon.''      Lensky had a curt word to say      and then sat silent all the way.      {86}          VI       Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming      to the Larins' had caused a spout      of gossip, and set comment humming      among the neighbours round about.      Conjecture found unending matter:      there was a general furtive chatter,      and jokes and spiteful gossip ran      claiming Tatyana'd found her man;      and some were even testifying      the marriage plans were all exact      but held up by the simple fact      that modish rings were still a-buying.      Of Lensky's fate they said no more --      they'd settled that some years before.          VII       Tatyana listened with vexation      to all this tattle, yet at heart      in indescribable elation,      despite herself, rehearsed the part:      the thought sank in, and penetrated:      she fell in love -- the hour was fated...      so fires of spring will bring to birth      a seedling fallen in the earth.      Her feelings in their weary session      had long been wasting and enslaved      by pain and languishment; she craved      the fateful diet; by depression      her heart had long been overrun:      her soul was waiting... for someone.      {87}          VIII       Tatyana now need wait no longer.      Her eyes were opened, and she said      ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,      in sultry sleep, in lonely bed,      all day, all night, his presence fills her,      by magic everything instils her      with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.      She hates a friendly voice's sound,      or servants waiting on her pleasure.      Sunk in dejection, she won't hear      the talk of guests when they appear;      she calls down curses on their leisure,      and, when one's least prepared for it      their tendency to call, and sit.          IX       Now, she devours, with what attention,      delicious novels, laps them up;      and all their ravishing invention      with sheer enchantment fills her cup!      These figures from the world of seeming,      embodied by the power of dreaming,      the lover of Julie Wolmar,3      and Malek Adel,4 de Linar,5      and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,      and Grandison beyond compare,      who sets me snoring then and there --      all for our tender dreamy maiden      are coloured in a single tone,      all blend into Eugene alone.      {88}          X       Seeing herself as a creation --      Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine6 --      by writers of her admiration,      Tatyana, lonely heroine,      roamed the still forest like a ranger,      sought in her book, that text of danger      and found her dreams, her secret fire,      the full fruit of her heart's desire;      she sighed, and in a trance coopted      another's joy, another's breast,      whispered by heart a note addressed      to the hero that she'd adopted.      But ours, whatever he might be,      ours was no Grandison -- not he.          XI       Lending his tone a grave inflection,      the ardent author of the past      showed one a pattern of perfection      in which his hero's mould was cast.      He gave this figure -- loved with passion,      wronged always in disgraceful fashion --      a soul of sympathy and grace,      and brains, and an attractive face.      Always our fervid hero tended      pure passion's flame, and in a trice      would launch into self-sacrifice;      always before the volume ended      due punishment was handed down      to vice, while virtue got its crown.      {89}          XII       Today a mental fog enwraps us,      each moral puts us in a doze,      even in novels, vice entraps us,      yes, even there its triumph grows.      Now that the British Muse is able      to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,      the idol that she'll most admire      is either the distrait Vampire,      Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,      Sbogar,8 mysterious through and through,      the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.      Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,      dressed up a desperate egoism      to look like sad romanticism.          XIII       In this, dear reader, if you know it,      show me the sense. Divine decree      may wind up my career as poet;      perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see      installed in me a different devil,      and sink to prose's humble level:      a novel on the established line      may then amuse my glad decline.      No secret crimes, and no perditions,      shall make my story grim as hell;      no, quite naively I'll retell      a Russian family's old traditions;      love's melting dreams shall fill my rhyme,      and manners of an earlier time.      {90}          XIV       I'll catalogue each simple saying      in father's or old uncle's book,      and tell of children's plighted playing      by ancient limes, or by a brook;      and after jealousy's grim weather      I'll part them, bring them back together;      I'll make them spar another round,      then to the altar, to be crowned.      I'll conjure up that swooning fashion      of ardent speech, that aching flow      of language which, so long ago,      facing a belle I loved with passion,      my tongue kept drawing from the heart --      but now I've rather lost the art.          XV       Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:      for you have, at this early date,      into a modish tyrant's keeping      resigned disposal of your fate.      Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;      but first, the dreams that hope can cherish      evoke for you a sombre bliss;      you learn life's sweetness, and with this      you drink the magic draught of yearning,      that poison brew; and in your mind      reverie hounds you, and you find      shelter for trysts at every turning;      in front of you, on every hand,      you see your fated tempter stand.      {91}          XVI       Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,      has made the park her brooding-place,      suddenly lowering eyes that languish,      too faint to stir a further pace:      her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring      scarlet with passion's instant flaring,      upon her lips the breathing dies,      noise in her ears, glare in her eyes...      then night comes on; the moon's patrolling      far-distant heaven's vaulted room;      a nightingale, in forest gloom,      sets a sonorous cadence rolling --      Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,      makes to her nurse low-voiced remark:          XVII       ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!      open the window, sit down near.''      ``Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.      The olden days, I want to hear...''      ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,      years back, to call up many a fable;      I kept in mind an ancient store      of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:      but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:      now I've forgotten all I knew.      A sorry state of things, it's true!      My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,      your early life, unlock your tongue:      were you in love when you were young?''      {92}          XVIII       ``What nonsense, Tanya! in those other      ages we'd never heard of love:      why, at the thought, my husband's mother      had chased me to the world above.''      ``How did you come to marry, nyanya?''      ``I reckon, by God's will. My Vanya      was younger still, but at that stage      I was just thirteen years of age.      Two weeks the matchmaker was plying      to see my kin, and in the end      my father blessed me. So I'd spend      my hours in fear and bitter crying.      Then, crying, they untwined my plait,      and sang me to the altar-mat.          XIX       ``So to strange kinsfolk I was taken...      but you're not paying any heed.''      ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,      I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.      I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''      ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,      the Lord have mercy on us all!      whatever you may need, just call...      I'll sprinkle you with holy water,      you're all in fever... heavens above.''      ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''      ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''      and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed      and put a cross-sign on the maid.      {93}          XX       ``I am in love,'' Tatyana's wailing      whisper repeated to the crone.      ``My dearest heart, you're sick and ailing.''      ``I am in love; leave me alone.''      And all the while the moon was shining      and with its feeble glow outlining      the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,      her drops of tears, and seated there,      in quilted coat, where rays were gleaming      on a small bench by Tanya's bed,      the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;      and everything around was dreaming,      in the deep stillness of the night,      bathed in the moon's inspiring light.          XXI       Tatyana watched the moon, and floated      through distant regions of the heart...      A thought was born, and quickly noted...      ``Go, nurse, and leave me here apart.      Give me a pen and give me paper,      bring up a table, and a taper;      good night; I swear I'll lie down soon.''      She was alone, lit by the moon.      Elbow on table, spirit seething,      still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,      and in her unconsidered note      all a pure maiden's love was breathing.      She folds the page, lays down the plume.,      Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?      {94}          XXII       I've known too many a haughty beauty,      cold, pure as ice, and as unkind,      inexorably wed to duty,      unfathomable to the mind;      shocked by their modish pride, and fleeing      the utter virtue of their being,      I've run a mile, I must avow,      having decyphered on their brow      hell's terrifying imprecation:      ``Abandon hope for evermore.''9      Our love is what they most abhor;      our terror is their consolation.      Ladies of such a cast, I think,      you too have seen on Neva's brink.          XXIII       Thronged by adorers, I've detected      another, freakish one, who stays      quite self-absorbed and unaffected      by sighs of passion or by praise.      To my astonishment I've seen her,      having by her severe demeanour      frightened to death a timid love,      revive it with another shove --      at least by a regretful kindness;      at least her tone is sometimes found      more tender than it used to sound.      I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,      the youthful lover once again      runs after what is sweet, and vain.      {95}          XXIV       Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?      is it that she, poor simple sweet,      believes in her elected dreaming      and has no knowledge of deceit?      that, artless, and without concealing,      her love obeys the laws of feeling,      that she's so trustful, and imbued      by heaven with such an unsubdued      imagination, with such reason,      such stubborn brain, and vivid will,      and heart so tender, it can still      burst to a fiery blaze in season?      Such feckless passion -- as I live,      is this then what you can't forgive?          XXV       The flirt has reason's cool volition;      Tatyana's love is no by-play,      she yields to it without condition      like a sweet child. She'll never say:      ``By virtue of procrastinating      we'll keep love's price appreciating,      we'll draw it deeper in our net;      first, we'll take vanity, and let      hope sting it, then we'll try deploying      doubts, to exhaust the heart, then fire      jealousy's flame, to light desire;      else, having found his pleasure cloying,      the cunning prisoner can quite well      at any hour escape his cell.''      {96}          XXVI       I see another problem looming:      to save the honour of our land      I must translate -- there's no presuming --      the letter from Tatyana's hand:      her Russian was as thin as vapour,      she never read a Russian paper,      our native speech had never sprung      unhesitating from her tongue,      she wrote in French... what a confession!      what can one do? as said above,      until this day, a lady's love      in Russian never found expression,      till now our language -- proud, God knows --      has hardly mastered postal prose.          XXVII       They should be forced to read in Russian,      I hear you say. But can you see      a lady -- what a grim discussion! --      with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?      I ask you, each and every poet!      the darling objects -- don't you know it? --      for whom, to expiate your crimes,      you've made so many secret rhymes,      to whom your hearts are dedicated,      is it not true that Russian speech,      so sketchily possessed by each,      by all is sweetly mutilated,      and it's the foreign phrase that trips      like native idiom from their lips?      {97}          XXVIII       Protect me from such apparition      on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,      as bonneted Academician      or seminarist in yellow shawl!      To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,      however scarlet; free from error      of grammar, Russian language too.      Now, to my cost it may be true      that generations of new beauties,      heeding the press, will make us look      more closely at the grammar-book;      that verse will turn to useful duties;      on me, all this has no effect:      tradition still keeps my respect.          XXIX       No, incorrect and careless chatter,      words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed      evoke emotion's pitter-patter,      now as before, inside my breast;      too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,      I still find Gallicism delicious      as youthful sinning, or the strains      of Bogdanóvich's11 refrains.      But that's enough. My beauty's letter      must now employ my pen; somehow      I gave my word, alas, though now      a blank default would suit me better.      I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme      is out of fashion in our time.      {98}          XXX       Bard13 of The Feasts, and heart's depression,      if you'd still been with me, dear friend,      I would have had the indiscretion      to ask of you that you transcend      in music's own bewitching fashion      the foreign words a maiden's passion      found for its utterance that night.      Where are you? come -- and my own right      with an obeisance I'll hand over...      But he, by sad and rocky ways,      with heart that's grown unused to praise,      on Finland's coast a lonely rover --      he doesn't hear when I address      his soul with murmurs of distress.          XXXI       Tatyana's letter, treasured ever      as sacred, lies before me still.      I read with secret pain, and never      can read enough to get my fill.      Who taught her an address so tender,      such careless language of surrender?      Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,      heartfelt, imploring, touching trash      fraught with enticement and disaster?      It baffles me. But I'll repeat      here a weak version, incomplete,      pale transcript of a vivid master,      or Freischütz as it might be played      by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:      {99}          Tatyana's Letter to Onegin       ``I write to you -- no more confession      is needed, nothing's left to tell.      I know it's now in your discretion      with scorn to make my world a hell.       ``But, if you've kept some faint impression      of pity for my wretched state,      you'll never leave me to my fate.      At first I thought it out of season      to speak; believe me: of my shame      you'd not so much as know the name,      if I'd possessed the slightest reason      to hope that even once a week      I might have seen you, heard you speak      on visits to us, and in greeting      I might have said a word, and then      thought, day and night, and thought again      about one thing, till our next meeting.      But you're not sociable, they say:      you find the country godforsaken;      though we... don't shine in any way,      our joy in you is warmly taken.       ``Why did you visit us, but why?      Lost in our backwoods habitation      I'd not have known you, therefore I      would have been spared this laceration.      In time, who knows, the agitation      of inexperience would have passed,      I would have found a friend, another,      and in the role of virtuous mother      and faithful wife I'd have been cast.      {100}       ``Another!... No, another never      in all the world could take my heart!      Decreed in highest court for ever...      heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;      and my whole life has been directed      and pledged to you, and firmly planned:      I know, Godsent one, I'm protected      until the grave by your strong hand:      you'd made appearance in my dreaming;      unseen, already you were dear,      my soul had heard your voice ring clear,      stirred at your gaze, so strange, so gleaming,      long, long ago... no, that could be      no dream. You'd scarce arrived, I reckoned      to know you, swooned, and in a second      all in a blaze, I said: it's he!       ``You know, it's true, how I attended,      drank in your words when all was still --      helping the poor, or while I mended      with balm of prayer my torn and rended      spirit that anguish had made ill.      At this midnight of my condition,      was it not you, dear apparition,      who in the dark came flashing through      and, on my bed-head gently leaning,      with love and comfort in your meaning,      spoke words of hope? But who are you:      the guardian angel of tradition,      or some vile agent of perdition      sent to seduce? Resolve my doubt.      Oh, this could all be false and vain,      a sham that trustful souls work out;      {101}      fate could be something else again..,       ``So let it be! for you to keep      I trust my fate to your direction,      henceforth in front of you I weep,      I weep, and pray for your protection..,      Imagine it: quite on my own      I've no one here who comprehends me,      and now a swooning mind attends me,      dumb I must perish, and alone.      My heart awaits you: you can turn it      to life and hope with just a glance --      or else disturb my mournful trance      with censure -- I've done all to earn it!       ``I close. I dread to read this page...      for shame and fear my wits are sliding...      and yet your honour is my gage      and in it boldly I'm confiding''...      {102}          XXXII       Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;      the letter trembles in her grip;      the rosy sealing-wafer's drying      upon her feverish tongue; the slip      from off her charming shoulder's drooping,      and sideways her poor head is stooping.      But now the radiance of the moon      is dimmed. Down there the valley soon      comes clearer through the mists of dawning.      Down there, by slow degrees, the stream      has taken on a silvery gleam;      the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning      and roused the village long ago:      to Tanya, all's an empty show.          XXXIII       She's paid the sunrise no attention,      she sits with head sunk on her breast,      over the note holds in suspension      her seal with its engraven crest.      Softly the door is opened, enter      grey Filatevna, to present her      with a small tray and a teacup.      ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!      Why, pretty one, you're up already!      My early bird! you know, last night      you gave me such a shocking fright!      but now, thank God, you're well and steady,      your night of fretting's left no trace!      fresh as a poppy-flower, your face.''      {103}          XXXIV       ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''      ``Command me, darling, as you choose.''      ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...      but, nurse, you see... Oh, don't refuse...''      ``My sweet, God warrants me your debtor.''      ``Then send your grandson with this letter      quickly to O... I mean to that...      the neighbour... you must tell the brat      that not a syllable be uttered      and not a mention of my name...''      ``Which neighbour, dear? My head became      in these last years all mixed and fluttered.      We've many neighbours round about;      even to count them throws me out.''          XXXV       ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''      ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,      I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;      times were when I was sharp and bold:      times were, when master's least suggestion...''      ``Oh nyanya, nyanya, I don't question...      what have your wits to do with me?      Now here's a letter, as you see,      addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.      But don't be cross, my darling friend,      you know I'm hard to comprehend...      Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''      ``It's nothing, nurse, nothing, I say...      just send your grandson on his way.''      {104}          XXXVI       Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.      No word: another day goes by.      She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,      demanding: when will he reply?      Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.      ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''      enquired the lady of the hall:      ``it seems that he forgot us all.''      Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.      ``Today he promised he'd be here,''      so Lensky answered the old dear:      ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''      Tatyana lowered her regard      as at a censure that was hard.          XXXVII       Day faded; on the table, glowing,      the samovar of evening boiled,      and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing      beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.      Already Olga's hand was gripping      the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping      into the cups its darkling stream --      meanwhile a hallboy handed cream;      before the window taking station,      plunged in reflection's deepest train,      Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,      and in the misted condensation      with charming forefinger she traced      ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.      {105}          XXXVIII       Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,      and tears were drowning her regard.      A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...      Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard      Evgeny! ``Ah!'' Tatyana, fleeting      light as a shadow, shuns a meeting,      through the back porch runs out and flies      down to the garden, and her eyes      daren't look behind her; fairly dashing --      beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,      the allée to the lake, the copse;      breaking the lilac bushes, smashing      parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,      to gasp, and on a bench to sink.          XXXIX       She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!      Oh God, what did he think!'' A dream      of hope is somehow still surviving      in her torn heart -- a fickle gleam;      she trembles, and with fever drumming      awaits him -- hears nobody coming.      Maidservants on the beds just now      were picking berries from the bough,      singing in chorus as directed      (on orders which of course presume      that thievish mouths cannot consume      their masters' berries undetected      so long as they're employed in song:      such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --      {106}          The Song of the Girls       ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,      dear companions, darling friends,      pretty maidens, romp away,      have your fill of revelry!      Strike the ditty up, my sweets,      ditty of our secret world,      and entice a fellow in      to the circle of our dance.      When we draw a fellow in,      when we see him from afar,      darlings, then we'll run away,      cherries then we'll throw at him,      cherries throw and raspberries      and redcurrants throw at him.      Never come and overhear      ditties of our secret world,      never come and like a spy      watch the games we maidens play.''      {107}          XL       They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding      choruses, Tanya can but wait,      listless, impatient, for the pounding      within her bosom to abate,      and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;      but wildly still her heart is rushing,      and on her cheeks the fever stays,      more and more brightly still they blaze.      So the poor butterfly will quiver      and beat a nacreous wing when caught      by some perverse schoolboy for sport;      and so in winter-fields will shiver      the hare who from afar has seen      a marksman crouching in the green.          XLI       But finally she heaved a yearning      sigh, and stood up, began to pace;      she walked, but just as she was turning      into the allée, face to face,      she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,      still as a shadow, grim and bitter;      seared as by fire, she stopped. Today      I lack the strength required to say      what came from this unlooked-for meeting;      my friends, I need to pause a spell,      and walk, and breathe, before I tell      a story that still wants completing;      I need to rest from all this rhyme:      I'll end my tale some other time.
4	      With womankind, the less we love them,           the easier they become to charm,           the tighter we can stretch above them           enticing nets to do them harm.           There was a period when cold-blooded           debauchery was praised, and studied           as love's technique, when it would blare           its own perfection everywhere,           and heartless pleasure was up-graded;           yes, these were our forefathers' ways,           those monkeys of the good old days:           now Lovelace's renown has faded           as scarlet heels have lost their name           and stately periwigs, their fame.           {109}               VIII            How dull are acting and evasion,           diversely urging the same plea,           earnestly striving for persuasion           on points that all long since agree --           and always the self-same objection;           how dull to work for the correction           of prejudice that's never been           harboured by maidens of thirteen!           Who's not disgusted by cajoling,           threats, vows, and simulated fears,           by six-page letters, rings and tears,           gossip, and tricks, and the patrolling           of aunts and mothers, and the thrall           of husband's friendship -- worst of all!               IX            Evgeny thought in just this fashion.           From his first youth he'd known the force,           the sufferings of tempestuous passion;           its winds had blown him far off course.           Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,           now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,           now disenchanted with the next,           more and more bored by yearning's text,           bored by success' giddy trifle,           he heard in stillness and in din           a deathless murmur from within,           found that in laughter yawns could stifle:           he killed eight years in such a style,           and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.           {110}               X            Though belles had lost his adoration,           he danced attendance with the best;           rebuffed, found instant consolation;           deceived, was overjoyed to rest.           He followed them without illusion,           lost them without regret's contusion,           scarcely recalled their love, their spite;           just like a casual guest who might           devote to whist an evening party,           who'd sit, and at the end of play           would say goodbye and drive away,           go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,           and in the morning wouldn't know           that self-same evening where he'd go.               XI            Yet Tanya's note made its impression           on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:           that virgin dream and its confession           filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;           the flower-like pallor of the maiden,           her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,           all plunged his soul deep in the stream           of a delicious, guiltless dream...           and though perhaps old fires were thrusting           and held him briefly in their sway,           Eugene had no wish to betray           a soul so innocent, so trusting.           But to the garden, to the scene           where Tanya now confronts Eugene.           {111}               XII            Moments of silence, quite unbroken;           then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:           ``You wrote to me, and nothing spoken           can disavow that. I have read           those words where love, without condition,           pours out its guiltless frank admission,           and your sincerity of thought           is dear to me, for it has brought           feeling to what had long been heartless:           but I won't praise you -- let me join           and pay my debt in the same coin           with an avowal just as artless;           hear my confession as I stand           I leave the verdict in your hand.               XIII            ``Could I be happy circumscribing           my life in a domestic plot;           had fortune blest me by prescribing           husband and father as my lot;           could I accept for just a minute           the homely scene, take pleasure in it --           then I'd have looked for you alone           to be the bride I'd call my own.           Without romance, or false insistence,           I'll say: with past ideals in view           I would have chosen none but you           as helpmeet in my sad existence,           as gage of all things that were good,           and been as happy... as I could!           {112}               XIV            ``But I was simply not intended           for happiness -- that alien role.           Should your perfections be expended           in vain on my unworthy soul?           Believe (as conscience is my warrant),           wedlock for us would be abhorrent.           I'd love you, but inside a day,           with custom, love would fade away;           your tears would flow -- but your emotion,           your grief would fail to touch my heart,           they'd just enrage it with their dart.           What sort of roses, in your notion,           would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might           last many a day, and many a night!               XV            ``What in the world is more distressing           than households where the wife must moan           the unworthy husband through depressing           daytimes and evenings passed alone?           and where the husband, recognizing           her worth (but anathematising           his destiny) without a smile           bursts with cold envy and with bile?           For such am I. When you were speaking           to me so simply, with the fires           and force that purity inspires,           is this the man that you were seeking?           can it be true you must await           from cruel fortune such a fate?           {113}               XVI            ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;           a soul that nothing can renew...           I feel a brotherly affection,           or something tenderer still, for you.           Listen to me without resentment:           girls often change to their contentment           light dreams for new ones... so we see           each springtime, on the growing tree,           fresh leaves... for such is heaven's mandate.           You'll love again, but you must teach           your heart some self-restraint; for each           and every man won't understand it           as I have... learn from my belief           that inexperience leads to grief.''               XVII            So went his sermon. Almost dying,           blinded to everything about           by mist of tears, without replying           Tatyana heard Evgeny out.           He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,           by what's called machinal reaction,           without a word Tatyana leant           upon it, and with head down-bent           walked homeward round the kitchen garden;           together they arrived, and none           dreamt of reproving what they'd done:           by country freedom, rightful pardon           and happy licence are allowed,           as much as in Moscow the proud.           {114}               XVIII            Agree, the way Eugene proceeded           with our poor girl was kind and good;           not for the first time he succeeded           in manifesting, as he could,           a truly noble disposition;           yet people's malice and suspicion           persisted and made no amends.           By enemies, no less by friends           (it's all the same -- you well correct us),           he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.           We each have enemies in this world,           but from our friends, good Lord protect us!           Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,           with cause that I've recalled them here.               XIX            What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending           to sleep some black and empty dreams;           but, inside brackets, I'm contending           there's no ignoble tale that seems           cooked-up where garret-vermin babble,           endorsed by fashionable rabble,           there's no absurdity as such,           no vulgar epigram too much,           which smilingly your friend, supported           by decent company, has not,           without a trace of spite or plot,           a hundred times afresh distorted;           yet he'd back you through thick and thin:           he loves you... like your kith and kin!           {115}               XX            Hm, hm. Distinguished reader, tell me           how are your kith and kin today?           And here my sentiments impel me           for your enlightenment to say           how I interpret this expression:           our kin are folk whom by profession           we have to cherish and admire           with all our hearts, and who require           that in the usual Christmas scrimmage           we visit them, or without fail           send them good wishes through the mail           to ensure that till next time our image           won't even cross their minds by stealth...           God grant them years and years of health!               XXI            Of course, the love of tender beauties,           surer than friendship or than kin,           will loyally discharge its duties,           in midst of trouble, storm or din.           Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,           yet a capricious inclination,           yet floods of talk around the town...           the darling sex is light as down.           Then verdicts from her husband's quartet           are bound, by every virtuous wife,           to be respected all through life:           and so your faithfullest supporter           will disappear as fast as smoke:           for Satan, love's a splendid joke.           {116}               XXII            Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?           On whom alone can we depend?           Who is there who will truly measure           his acts and words to suit our end?           Who'll sow no calumnies around us?           Whose fond attentions will astound us?           Who'll never fault our vices, or           whom shall we never find a bore?           Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,           don't waste your efforts on the air.           Just let yourself be your whole care,           your loved one, honourable reader!           Deserving object: there can be           nothing more lovable than he.               XXIII            Then what resulted from the meeting?           Alas, it's not so hard to guess!           Love's frantic torments went on beating           and racking with their strain and stress           that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;           no, all devoured by passion's madness           poor Tanya more intensely burns;           sleep runs from her, she turns and turns...           and health, life's sweetness and its shimmer,           smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,           have vanished, like an empty noise,           while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:           so a storm-shadow wraps away           in dark attire the new-born day.           {117}               XXIV            Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,           and pale, and fade without a word!           there's nothing can employ her anguish,           no sound by which her soul is stirred.           Neighbours in whispered tones are taking           council, and with profound head-shaking           conclude that it's high time she wed!...           But that's enough. At once, in stead,           I'll gladden your imagination,           reader, by painting you a scene           of happy love. For I have been           too long, against my inclination,           held in constraint by pity's touch:           I love my Tatyana too much!               XXV            From hour to hour a surer capture           for Olga's beauty, Lensky gives           his soul to a delicious rapture           that fills him and in which he lives.           He's always with her: either seated           in darkness in her room, or treated           to garden walks, as arm in arm           they while away the morning's calm.           What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,           he even dares, once in a while,           emboldened by his Olga's smile,           and plunged in tender shame's confusion,           to play with a dishevelled tress,           or kiss the border of her dress.           {118}               XXVI            He reads to Olga on occasion,           for her improvement, a roman,           of moralistical persuasion,           more searching than Chateaubriand;           but in it there are certain pages           (vain twaddle, fables of the ages,           talk that might turn a young girl's head)           which with a blush he leaves unread.           As far removed as they were able           from all the world, they sat and pored           in deepest thought at the chess-board           for hours, with elbows on the table --           then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,           deep in distraction, his own rook.               XXVII            Even at home his occupation           is only Olga: he relieves           with careful schemes of decoration           an album's loose and floating sheaves.           Sometimes a landscape's represented,           a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,           a lyre, and on it perched, a dove --           in ink with colour-wash above;           then on the leaves of recollection,           below the others who have signed           he leaves a tender verse behind,           a dream's mute monument, reflection           of instant thoughts, a fleeting trace           still after many years in place.           {119}               XXVIII            Often of course you'll have inspected           the album of a country miss           where scribbling friends have interjected           frontwise and back, that way and this.           With spelling scrambled to perdition,           the unmetric verses of tradition           are entered here, in friendship's gage,           shortened, or lengthened off the page.           On the first sheet you'll find a question:           ``Qu'écrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?''           and, under, ``toute à vous Annette'';           then, on the last page, the suggestion:           ``who loves you more than I, let's see           him prove it, writing after me.''               XXIX            There you're entirely sure of finding           two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;           and there, love's protestations, binding           until the tombstone; there one day           some regimental bard has added           a stanza villainously padded.           In such an album, friends, I too           am always glad to write, it's true,           convinced at heart that my most zealous           nonsense will earn indulgent looks,           nor will my scribbling in such books           attract the sneering of the jealous,           or make men seriously discuss           if I show wit in jesting thus.           {120}               XXX            But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,           odd volumes from the devil's shelf,           in which the rhymester-man-of-fashion           is forced to crucify himself,           portfolios nobly illustrated           with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated           by Baratynsky's3 wondrous pen,           God's thunder burn you up! And when           some splendid lady is referring           to me her best in-quarto tome,           the fear and rage with which I foam!           Deep down, an epigram is stirring           that I'm just longing to indite --           but madrigals I've got to write!               XXXI            No madrigals were for inscribing           by Lensky in his Olga's book;           his style breathed love, and not the gibing           coldness of wit; each note he took,           each news of her he'd been imbibing --           all was material for transcribing:           with lively and pellucid look,           his elegies flow like a brook.           So you, inspired Yazýkov,4 sobbing           with bursts of passion from the heart,           sing God knows whom, compose with art           a suite of elegies that, throbbing,           sooner or later will relate           the entire story of your fate.           {121}               XXXII            But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,           bidding us to reject for good           the elegy, grown paralytic,           commands our rhymester-brotherhood:           ``oh, quit your stale, your tedious quacking,           and your alas-ing and alack-ing           about what's buried in the past:           sing about something else at last!''           All right, you want the resurrection           of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,           and dead ideas from that old hoard,           all brought to life at your direction.           Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,           that's the refrain that you should sing,               XXXIII            ``as sung of old, in years of glory,           as instituted long ago.''           Only the ode, that solemn story!           Enough, my friends; it's all so-so.           Remember the retort satiric!           Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,           really more bearable to you           than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?           ``The elegy's just vain protesting,           empty the purpose it proclaims,           while odes have high and noble aims...''           That point I wouldn't mind contesting,           but hold my tongue, lest it appears           I'll set two ages by the ears.           {122}               XXXIV            In love with fame, by freedom smitten,           with storm and tumult in his head,           what odes Vladimir might have written --           but Olga would have never read!           Bards of our tearful generation,           have you read lines of your creation           to your loved ones? They do maintain           that this of all things for a swain           is the supreme reward. Precisely,           blest the poor lover who reads out           his dreams, while she whom they're about,           that languid beauty, listens nicely --           blest... though perhaps her fancy's caught           in fact by some quite different thought.               XXXV            But I myself read my bedizened           fancies, my rhythmic search for truth,           to nobody except a wizened           nanny, companion of my youth;           or, after some dull dinner's labour,           I buttonhole a wandering neighbour           and in a corner make him choke           on tragedy; but it's no joke,           when, utterly worn out by rhyming,           exhausted and done up, I take           a rambling walk beside my lake,           and duck get up; with instant timing,           alarmed by my melodious lay,           they leave their shores and fly away.           {123}               XXXVI6            < My gaze pursues them... but on station           the hunter in the wood will swear           at verse, and hiss an imprecation,           and ease his catch with all due care.           We each enjoy a special hobby,           each of us has his favourite lobby:           one sees a duck and aims his gun,           one raves in verse like me, and one           hunts cheeky flies, with swatter sweeping,           one leads the multitude in thought,           one finds in war amusing sport,           one wallows in delicious weeping;           the wine-addict adores the cup:           and good and bad are all mixed up. >               XXXVII            But what about Eugene? With reason           reader, you ask, and I'll expound --           craving your tolerance in season --           the programme of his daily round.           In summertime -- for he was leading           a hermit's life -- he'd be proceeding           on foot, by seven o'clock, until           he reached the stream below the hill;           lightly attired, like the creator           of Gulnare, he would play a card           out of the hand of that same bard:           he'd swim this Hellespont; then later           he'd drink his coffee, flutter through           the pages of some dull review,           then dress...           {124}               (XXXVIII) XXXIX            Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,           the shady wood, the talking stream;           sometimes from a fair, black-eyed maiden           the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;           a steed responsive to the bridle,           and dinner with a touch of idle           fancy, a wine serene in mood,           tranquillity, and solitude --           Onegin's life, you see, was holy;           unconsciously he let it mount           its grip on him, forgot to count           bright summer days that passed so slowly,           forgot to think of town and friends           and tedious means to festive ends.               XL            Our evanescent northern summer           parodies winter in the south;           it's like a vanishing newcomer --           but here we must control our mouth.           The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,           and good old sun more seldom glowing;           the days grew shorter, in the glade           with mournful sound the secret shade           was stripped away, and mists encroaching           lay on the fields; in caravan           the clamorous honking geese began           their southward flight: one saw approaching           the season which is such a bore --           November stood outside the door.           {125}               XLI            Dawn comes in mist and chill; no longer           do fields echo with work and shout;           in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,           on the highroad the wolves come out;           the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,           sets the wise traveller cavorting           up the hillside at breakneck pace;           no longer does the herdsman chase           his beasts outdoors at dawn, nor ringing           at noontime does his horn resound           as it assembles them around;           while in the hut a girl is singing;           she spins and, friend of winter nights,           the matchwood chatters as it lights.               XLII            Hoar-frost that crackles with a will is           already silvering all the plain...           (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:           here, seize it quick for this quatrain!)           Like modish parquetry, the river           glitters beneath its icing-sliver;           boy-tribes with skates on loudly slice           their joyous way across the ice;           a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,           anticipates a swim, in stead           tries out the ice with cautious tread,           and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful           first flakes of snow whirl round and sink           in stars upon the river-brink.           {126}               XLIII            In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?           Walking? The country that you roam           is a compulsive bore by reason           of its unvarnished monochrome.           Riding on the lugubrious prairie?           Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,           will find the ice elude his grip           and, any moment, down he'll slip.           Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,           you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!           to pass the evening. No? then tot           up your accounts, and raging, toping,           let evening pass, tomorrow too --           in triumph you'll see winter through!               XLIV            Childe-Harold-like, Eugene's devoting           his hours to dreaming them away:           he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;           and then, indoors the livelong day,           alone, and sunk in calculation,           with a blunt cue for the duration,           from early morning on he will           at two-ball billiards prove his skill;           then, country evening fast arriving,           billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:           before the fire a table's spread;           Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,           with three roan horses in a line           Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!           {127}               XLV            From widow Clicquot and from Moët,           the draught whose blessings are agreed,           in frosted bottle, for the poet           is brought to table at full speed.           Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;           once, with its foaming and its playing,           (a simile of this and that)           it held me captive; tit for tat,           friends, recollect how I surrendered           my last poor lepton for a sup!           recall, by its bewitching cup,           how many follies were engendered;           how many lines of verse, and themes           for jokes, and rows, and merry dreams!               XLVI            Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,           perfidious blow to my inside,           and now it's Bordeaux the Judicious           that I prefer to Champagne's tide;           to Aÿ's vintage in the sequel           I find myself no longer equal;           for, mistress-like, it's brilliant, vain,           lively, capricious, and inane...           But in misfortune or displeasure,           Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,           a true companion to the end,           ready to share our quiet leisure           with your good offices, and so           long life to our dear friend, Bordeaux!           {128}               XLVII            The fire was dying; cinders faintly           covered the golden coal -- the steam           tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly           its barely noticeable stream.           The hearth was low beyond all stoking.           Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.           Still on the board, the beakers hissed,           and evening now drew on in mist...           (I like a friendly conversation,           the enjoyment of a friendly drink,           at hours, which, why I cannot think,           somehow have got the designation           of time between the wolf and dog.)           Now hear the friends in dialogue:               XLVIII            ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?           and how's Tatyana? Olga too,           your dashing one, is she surviving?''           ``Just half a glass more... that will do...           All flourishing; they send their duty.           Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!           What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day           visit the family, what d'you say?           if you come with me, they'll be flattered;           or else, my friend, how does it look?           you called there twice, and since then took           no notice of them. But I've chattered           so much, I'm left no time to speak!           of course! you're bidden there next week.''           {129}               XLIX            ``I?'' ``Saturday. The invitation           Olinka and her mother sent:           Tatyana's name day celebration.           It's right and proper that you went.''           ``But there'll be such a rout and scrabble           with every different kind of rabble...''           ``No, no, I'm sure the party's small.           Relations. No-one else at all.           Let's go, our friendship's worth the labour!''           ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''           He drained his glass down to the end           by way of toast to their fair neighbour;           then he began to talk once more           of Olga: love's that kind of bore!               L            Lensky rejoiced. His designated           rapture was just two weeks ahead;           love's crown, delectable, awaited           his transports, and the marriage-bed           in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,           the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing           onset of the incipient yawn,           were from his vision quite withdrawn.           While under the connubial banner           I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,           beyond a string of dull tableaux,           a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...           my wretched Lensky in his heart           was just created for the part.           {130}               LI            And he was loved... at least he never           doubted of it, so lived in bliss.           Happy a hundredfold, whoever           can lean on faith, who can dismiss           cold reason, sleep in sensual welter           like a drunk traveller in a shelter,           or, sweeter, like a butterfly           in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:           but piteous he, the all-foreseeing,           the sober head, detesting each           human reaction, every speech           in the expression of its being,           whose heart experience has cooled           and saved from being charmed or fooled!
5	           I                 That year the season was belated                and autumn lingered, long and slow;                expecting winter, nature waited --                only in January the snow,                night of the second, started flaking.                Next day Tatyana, early waking,                saw through the window, morning-bright,                roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,                panes patterned by the finest printer,                with trees decked in their silvery kit,                and jolly magpies on the flit,                and hills that delicately winter                had with its brilliant mantle crowned --                and glittering whiteness all around.                {132}                    II                 Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,                breaks a new passage with his sleigh;                his nag has smelt the snow, and planted                a shambling hoof along the way;                a saucy kibítka is slicing                its furrow through the powdery icing;                the driver sits and cuts a dash                in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash.                Here comes the yard-boy, who has chosen                his pup to grace the sledge, while he                becomes a horse for all to see;                the rogue has got a finger frozen:                it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain                his mother taps the window-pane.                    III                 But you perhaps find no attraction                in any picture of this kind:                for nature's unadorned reaction                has something low and unrefined.                Fired by the god of inspiration,                another bard1 in exaltation                has painted for us the first snow                with each nuance of wintry glow:                he'll charm you with his fine invention,                he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire                secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;                but I've not got the least intention                just now of wrestling with his shade,                nor his,2 who sings of Finland's maid.                {133}                    IV                 Tanya (profoundly Russian being,                herself not knowing how or why)                in Russian winters thrilled at seeing                the cold perfection of the sky,                hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,                sledges, and tardy dawns together                with the pink glow the snows assume                and festal evenings in the gloom.                The Larins kept the old tradition:                maid-servants from the whole estate                would on those evenings guess the fate                of the two girls; their premonition                pointed each year, for time to come,                at soldier-husbands, and the drum.                    V                 Tatyana shared with full conviction                the simple faith of olden days                in dreams and cards and their prediction,                and portents of the lunar phase.                Omens dismayed her with their presage;                each object held a secret message                for her instruction, and her breast                was by forebodings much oppressed.                The tomcat, mannered and affected,                that sat above the stove and purred                and washed its face, to her brought word                that visitors must be expected.                If suddenly aloft she spied                the new moon, horned, on her left side,                {134}                    VI                 her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.                In the dark sky, a shooting star                that fell, and then began to shiver,                would fill Tatyana from afar                with perturbation and with worry;                and while the star still flew, she'd hurry                to whisper it her inmost prayer.                And if she happened anywhere                to meet a black monk, or if crossing                her path a hare in headlong flight                ran through the fields, sheer panic fright                would leave her dithering and tossing.                By dire presentiment awestruck,                already she'd assume ill-luck.                    VII                 Yet -- fear itself she found presented                a hidden beauty in the end:                our disposition being invented                by nature, contradiction's friend.                Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!                Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,                youth which has nothing to regret,                before which life's horizon yet                lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;                spectacled age divines as well,                although it's nearly heard the knell,                and all is lost beyond retrieving;                no matter: hope, in child's disguise,                is there to lisp its pack of lies.                {135}                    VIII                 Tatyana looks with pulses racing                at sunken wax inside a bowl:                beyond a doubt, its wondrous tracing                foretells for her some wondrous role;                from dish of water, rings are shifted                in due succession; hers is lifted                and at the very self-same time                the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:                ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,                they heap up silver with a spade;                and those we sing for will be paid                in goods and fame!'' But the sad-sounding                ditty portends a loss; more dear                is ``Kit''3 to every maiden's ear.                    IX                 The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;                the heavenly lights in glorious quire                tread the calm, settled path they've chosen...                Tatyana in low-cut attire                goes out into the courtyard spaces                and trains a mirror till it faces                the moon; but in the darkened glass                the only face to shake and pass                is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...                a passer-by; and on tiptoe                she flies as fast as she can go;                and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking                in a melodious, flute-like tone.                He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4                {136}                    X                 Prepared for prophecy and fable,                she did what nurse advised she do                and in the bath-house had a table                that night, in secret, set for two;                then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...                I too -- when I recall Svetlana5                I'm terrified -- so let it be...                Tatyana's rites are not for me.                She's dropped her sash's silken billow;                Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.                Lel6 floats about above her head;                and underneath her downy pillow                a young girl's looking-glass is kept.                Now all was still. Tatyana slept.                    XI                 She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming                she walked across a snowy plain                through gloom and mist; and there came streaming                a furious, boiling, heaving main                across the drift-encumbered acres,                a raging torrent, capped with breakers,                a flood on which no frosty band                had been imposed by winter's hand;                two poles that ice had glued like plaster                were placed across the gulf to make                a flimsy bridge whose every quake                spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;                she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,                perplexed... and rooted to the ground.                {137}                    XII                 As if before some mournful parting                Tatyana groaned above the tide;                she saw no friendly figure starting                to help her from the other side;                but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,                and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,                enormous bear; Tatyana yelled,                the bear let out a roar, and held                a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing                her nerves, she leant on it her weight,                and with a halting, trembling gait                above the water started tracing                her way; she passed, then as she walked                the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.                    XIII                 A backward look is fraught with danger;                she speeds her footsteps to a race,                but from her shaggy-liveried ranger                she can't escape at any pace --                the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.                Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers                in the full beauty of its frown;                the branches all are weighted down                with tufts of snow; and through the lifted                summits of aspen, birch and lime,                the nightly luminaries climb.                No path to see: the snow has drifted                across each bush, across each steep,                and all the world is buried deep.                {138}                    XIV                 She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.                There's powdery snow up to her knees;                now a protruding branch assails her                and clasps her neck; and now she sees                her golden earrings off and whipping;                and now the crunchy snow is stripping                her darling foot of its wet shoe,                her handkerchief has fallen too;                no time to pick it up -- she's dying                with fright, she hears the approaching bear;                her fingers shake, she doesn't dare                to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,                and he pursuing, till at length                she flies no more, she's lost her strength.                    XV                 She's fallen in the snow -- alertly                the bear has raised her in his paws;                and she, submissively, inertly --                no move she makes, no breath she draws;                he whirls her through the wood... a hovel                shows up through trees, all of a grovel                in darkest forest depths and drowned                by dreary snowdrifts piled around;                there's a small window shining in it,                and from within come noise and cheer;                the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --                come in and warm yourself a minute!''                he carries her inside the door                and sets her gently on the floor.                {139}                    XVI                 Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:                bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;                behind the door the clash of glasses                and shouts suggest a crowded wake;                so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,                no meaning in or out of season,                she peers discreetly through a chink                and sees... whatever do you think?                a group of monsters round a table,                a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,                a rooster head, and on the twitch                a skeleton jerked by a cable,                a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,                a hybrid cross of cat and crane.                    XVII                 But ever stranger and more fearful:                a crayfish rides on spider-back;                on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful                and swaggers in a red calpack;                with bended knees a windmill dances,                its sails go flap-flap as it prances;                song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,                and human words, and horse's stamp!                But how she jumped, when in this hovel                among the guests she recognized                the man she feared and idolized --                who else? -- the hero of our novel!                Onegin sits at table too,                he eyes the door, looks slyly through.                {140}                    XVIII                 He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;                he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;                he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;                he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;                he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened                Tanya's no longer quite so frightened                and, curious now about the lot,                opens the door a tiny slot...                but then a sudden breeze surprises,                puts out the lamps; the whole brigade                of house-familiars stands dismayed...                with eyes aflame Onegin rises                from table, clattering on the floor;                all stand. He walks towards the door.                    XIX                 Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry                Tatyana struggles to run out --                she can't; and in her panic hurry                she flails around, she tries to shout --                she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,                and to the vision of those mortal                monsters the maiden stood revealed.                Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;                the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,                the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,                the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,                the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --                all point at her, and all combine                to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''                {141}                    XX                 ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder                clears in a flash the freezing room;                the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,                the girl remains there in the gloom                alone with him; Onegin takes her                into a corner, gently makes her                sit on a flimsy bench, and lays                his head upon her shoulder... blaze                of sudden brightness... it's too curious...                Olga's appeared upon the scene,                and Lensky follows her... Eugene,                eyes rolling, arms uplifted, furious,                damns the intruders; Tanya lies                and almost swoons, and almost dies.                    XXI                 Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:                Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,                a carving-knife -- and in the tangle                Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick                and growing thicker; then, heart-shaking,                a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...                Tanya comes to in utter fright...                she looks, the room is getting light --                outside, the scarlet rays of dawning                play on the window's frosted lace;                in through the door, at swallow's pace,                pinker than glow of Northern morning,                flits Olga: ``now, tell me straight out,                who was it that you dreamt about?''                {142}                    XXII                 Deaf to her sister's intervention,                Tatyana simply lay in bed,                devoured a book with rapt attention,                and kept quite silent while she read.                The book displayed, not so you'd know it,                no magic fancies of the poet,                no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;                and yet by Vergil or Racine                by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,                even by Ladies' Fashion Post,                no one was ever so engrossed:                Martin Zadéka was the siren,                dean of Chaldea's learned team,                arch-commentator of the dream.                    XXIII                 This work of the profoundest learning                was brought there by a huckster who                one day came down that lonely turning,                and to Tanya, when he was through,                swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,                but just to make the bargain keener,                he charged three roubles and a half,                and took two Petriads in calf,                a grammar, a digest of fable,                and volume three of Marmontel.                Since then Martin Zadéka's spell                bewitches Tanya... he is able                to comfort her in all her woes,                and every night shares her repose.                {143}                    XXIV                 Tatyana's haunted by her vision,                plagued by her ghastly dream, and tries                to puzzle out with some precision                just what the nightmare signifies.                Searching the table exegetic                she finds, in order alphabetic:                bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,                fir, forest, hedgehog, raven, snow                etcetera. But her trepidation                Martin Zadéka fails to mend;                the horrid nightmare must portend                a hideous deal of tribulation.                For several days she peaked and pined                in deep anxiety of mind.                    XXV                 But now Aurora's crimson fingers                from daybreak valleys lift the sun;                the morning light no longer lingers,                the festal name day has begun.                Since dawn, whole families have been driving                towards the Larins' and arriving                in sledded coaches and coupés,                in britzkas, kibítkas and sleighs.                The hall is full of noise and hustle,                in the salon new faces meet,                and kisses smack as young girls greet;                there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;                the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,                guests bow, feet scrape, and children squall.                {144}                    XXVI                 Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,                fat Pústyakov has driven in;                Gvozdín, exemplary farmer,                whose serfs are miserably thin;                and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,                with broods of children of all ages,                from thirty down to two; and stop,                here's Petushkóv, the local fop;                and look, my cousin's come, Buyánov,                in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --                you'll recognize him soon enough, --                and counsellor (retired) Flyánov,                that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,                bribe-taker, glutton and buffoon.                    XXVII                 Here, in his red peruke and glasses,                late of Tambov, Monsieur Triquet                has come with Kharlikov; he passes                for witty; in his Gallic way                inside a pocket Triquet nurses,                addressed to Tanya, certain verses                set to well-known children's glee:                ``réveillez-vous, belle endormie.''                He found them in some old collection,                printed among outmoded airs;                Triquet, ingenious poet, dares                to undertake their resurrection,                and for belle Nina, as it read,                he's put belle Tatiana instead.                {145}                    XXVIII                 And from the nearby Army station                the Major's here: he's all the rage                with our Mamas, and a sensation                with demoiselles of riper age;                his news has set the party humming!                the regimental band is coming,                sent at the Colonel's own behest.                A ball: the joy of every guest!                Young ladies jump for future blisses...                But dinner's served, so two by two                and arm in arm they all go through;                round Tanya congregate the misses,                the men confront them, face to face:                they sit, they cross themselves for grace.                    XXIX                 They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --                jaws masticate as minutes pass:                the crash of plates and knives is blended                with the resounding chime of glass.                And now there's gradually beginning                among the guests a general dinning:                none listens when the others speak,                all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.                Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,                Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''                the hostess cries and, moving fast,                the guests squeeze closer to the centres;                they shove each plate, and every chair,                and shout, and make room for the pair.                {146}                    XXX                 Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;                and paler than the moon at dawn,                she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,                and trembles like a hunted fawn.                From violent passions fast pulsating                she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;                the friends' salute she never hears                and from her eyes the eager tears                are almost bursting; she's quite ready,                poor girl, to drop into a faint,                but will, and reason's strong constraint,                prevailed, and with composure steady                she sat there; through her teeth a word                came out so soft, it scarce was heard.                    XXXI                 The nervous-tragical reaction,                girls' tears, their swooning, for Eugene                had long proved tedious to distraction:                he knew too well that sort of scene.                Now, faced with this enormous revel,                he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.                He saw the sad girl's trembling state,                looked down in an access of hate,                pouted, and swore in furious passion                to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,                the best revenge one could desire.                Already, in exultant fashion,                he watched the guests and, as he dined,                caricatured them in his mind.                {147}                    XXXII                 Tanya's distress had risked detection                not only by Evgeny's eye;                but looks and talk took the direction,                that moment, of a luscious pie                (alas, too salted); now they're bringing                bottles to which some pitch is clinging:                Tsimlyansky wine, between the meat                and the blancmanger, then a fleet                of goblets, tall and slender pretties;                how they remind me of your stem,                Zizi, my crystal and my gem,                you object of my guileless ditties!                with draughts from love's enticing flask,                you made me drunk as one could ask!                    XXXIII                 Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle                explodes; wine fizzes up... but stay:                solemn, too long compelled to throttle                his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet                is on his feet -- in utter stillness                the party waits. Seized with an illness                of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;                and, scroll in hand, before her eyes                Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping                and cheers salute him. Tanya must                thank him by curtseying to the dust;                great bard despite his modest trapping,                he's first to toast her in the bowl,                then he presents her with the scroll.                {148}                    XXXIV                 Compliment and congratulation;                Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.                When Eugene's turn for salutation                arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,                her discomposure, her confusion,                expose his soul to an intrusion                of pity: in his silent bow,                and in his look there shows somehow                a wondrous tenderness. And whether                it was that he'd been truly stirred,                or half-unwittingly preferred                a joking flirt, or both together,                there was a softness in his glance:                it brought back Tanya from her trance.                    XXXV                 Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,                and all into the salon squeeze,                as from their luscious hive go tumbling                fieldward, in noisy swarm, the bees.                The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,                neighbours in high content are wheezing;                ladies at the fireside confer,                in corners whispering girls concur;                now, by green tablecloths awaited,                the eager players are enrolled --                Boston and ombre for the old,                and whist, that's now so keenly fêted --                pursuits of a monotonous breed                begot by boredom out of greed.                {149}                    XXXVI                 By now whist's heroes have completed                eight rubbers; and by now eight times                they've moved around and been reseated;                and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes                I like to tell the time by dinner                and tea and supper; there's an inner                clock in the country rings the hour;                no fuss; our belly has the power                of any Bréguet: and in passing                I'll just remark, my verses talk                as much of banquets and the cork                and eatables beyond all classing                as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,                whom thirty centuries have adored!                    < XXXVII7                 At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,                I put your genius to the test,                I make magnanimous confession,                in other things you come off best:                your heroes, raging and ferocious,                your battles, lawless and atrocious,                your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band                have clearly got the upper hand                of Eugene, cold as all creation,                of plains where boredom reigns complete,                or of Istómina, my sweet,                and all our modish education;                but your vile Helen's not my star --                no, Tanya's more endearing far.                {150}                    XXXVIII                 No one will think that worth gainsaying,                though Menelaus, in Helen's name,                may spend a century in flaying                the hapless Phrygians all the same,                and although Troy's greybeards, collected                around Priam the much-respected,                may chorus, when she comes in sight,                that Menelaus was quite right --                and Paris too. But hear my pleading:                as battles go, I've not begun;                don't judge the race before it's run --                be good enough to go on reading:                there'll be a fight. For that I give                my word; no welshing, as I live. >                    XXXIX                 Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,                taken the saucers in their grip,                when, from behind the doorway, hidden                bassoons and flutes begin to trip.                Elated by the music's blaring,                Petushkóv, local Paris, tearing,                his tea with rum quite left behind,                approaches Olga; Lensky's signed                Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,                that nubile maid of riper age,                is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;                Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;                they all have swarmed into the hall,                and in full brilliance shines the ball.                {151}                    XL                 Right at the outset of my story                (if you'll turn back to chapter one)                I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,                a ball in Petersburg; but fun                and charming reverie's vain deflection                absorbed me in the recollection                of certain ladies' tiny feet.                Enough I've wandered in the suite                of your slim prints! though this be treason                to my young days, it's time I turned                to wiser words and deeds, and learned                to demonstrate some signs of reason:                let no more such digressions lurk                in this fifth chapter of my work.                    XLI                 And now, monotonously dashing                like mindless youth, the waltz goes by                with spinning noise and senseless flashing                as pair by pair the dancers fly.                Revenge's hour is near, and after                Evgeny, full of inward laughter,                has gone to Olga, swept the girl                past all the assembly in a whirl,                he takes her to a chair, beginning                to talk of this and that, but then                after two minutes, off again,                they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.                All are dumbfounded. Lensky shies                away from trusting his own eyes.                {152}                    XLII                 Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder                used in times past to ring a peal                that huge ballrooms vibrated under,                while floors would split from crash of heel,                and frames would shudder, windows tremble;                now things are changed, now we resemble                ladies who glide on waxed parquet.                Yet the mazurka keeps today                in country towns and suchlike places                its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,                and whiskers -- all of this it keeps                as fresh as ever, for its graces                are here untouched by fashion's reign,                our modern Russia's plague and bane.                    XLIII7                    ... ...                 < Petushkóv's nails and spurs are sounding                (that half-pay archivist); and bounding                Buyánov's heels have split the wood                and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;                there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,                the deeper in the wood, the more                the logs; the wild ones have the floor;                they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.                Ah, gently, gently, easy goes --                your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >                {153}                    XLIV                 Buyánov, my vivacious cousin,                leads Olga and Tatyana on                to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,                Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;                he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,                he stoops and, tenderly confiding,                whispers some ballad of the hour,                squeezes her hand -- and brings to flower                on her smug face a flush of pleasure.                Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,                he's lost his self-command, and crazed                with jealousy beyond all measure                insists, when the mazurka ends,                on the cotillion, as amends.                    XLV                 He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?                No, she's already pledged her word                to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...                How could she? why, he'd never heard...                scarce out of bibs, already fickle,                fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,                already studying to intrigue,                already high in treason's league!                He finds the shock beyond all bearing:                so, cursing women's devious course,                he leaves the house, calls for his horse                and gallops. Pistols made for pairing                and just a double charge of shot                will in a flash decide his lot.
6	                I                      Seeing Vladimir had defected,                     Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked                     by fresh ennui as he reflected                     with pleasure on his vengeful act.                     Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,                     and looked for Lensky, while the labour                     of the cotillion's endless theme                     oppressed her like a heavy dream.                     It's over. Supper is proceeding.                     Beds are made up; the guests are all                     packed from the maids' wing to the hall.                     Each one by now is badly needing                     a place for rest. Eugene alone                     has driven off, to find his own.                     {155}                         II                      All sleep: from the saloon a roaring                     proclaims where ponderous Pústyakov                     beside his heavier half is snoring.                     Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv                     and Flyánov, amply lubricated,                     on dining-chairs are all prostrated;                     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,                     in flannel, and an old fur cap.                     In the two sisters' rooms extended,                     the maidens all are slumbering deep.                     Only Tatyana does not sleep,                     but at the window, in the splendid                     radiance of Dian, sits in pain                     and looks out on the darkened plain.                         III                      His unexpected apparition,                     the fleeting tenderness that stole                     into his look, the exhibition                     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;                     she can't make out a single fraction                     of his intent; and a reaction                     of jealousy has made her start,                     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,                     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,                     a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I                     am doomed to perish, yet to die                     through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling                     I find no sense; the truth is this,                     it's not in him to bring me bliss.''                     {156}                         IV                      But onward, onward with my story!                     A new acquaintance claims our quill.                     Five versts or so from Krasnogórie,                     Lensky's estate, there lives and still                     thrives to this moment, in a station                     of philosophic isolation,                     Zarétsky, sometime king of brawls                     and hetman of the gambling-halls,                     arch-rake, pothouse tribune-persona,                     but now grown plain and kind in stead,                     paterfamilias (unwed),                     unswerving friend, correct landowner,                     and even honourable man:                     so, if we want to change, we can!                         V                      The world of fashion, prone to flatter,                     praised his fierce courage in its day:                     true, with a pistol he could shatter                     an ace a dozen yards away;                     it's also true, in battle's rapture,                     the circumstances of his capture                     had made his name, when, bold as bold,                     down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled                     into the mud, a drunken goner,                     and taken by the French -- some prize! --                     resigned himself to prison's ties,                     like Regulus, that god of honour,                     in order daily, chez Véry,1                     to drain, on credit, bottles three.                     {157}                         VI                      Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,                     so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,                     so gloriously he'd fool the clever,                     using overt or covert rules.                     Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,                     or cause the bursting of his bubble,                     sometimes he'd fall into a trap                     himself just like a simple chap.                     But he could draw a joking moral,                     return an answer, blunt or keen,                     use cunning silence as a screen,                     or cunningly create a quarrel,                     get two young friends to pick a fight,                     and put them on a paced-out site.                         VII                      Or he knew how to reconcile them                     so that all three went off to lunch,                     then later slyly he'd revile them                     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:                     sed alia tempora! The devil                     (like passion's dream, that other revel)                     goes out of us when youth is dead.                     So my Zaretsky, as I said,                     beneath bird-cherries and acacias                     has found a port for his old age,                     and lives, a veritable sage,                     for planting cabbage, like Horatius,                     and breeding ducks and geese as well,                     and teaching children how to spell.                     {158}                         VIII                      He was no fool; appreciated                     by my Eugene, not for his heart,                     but for the effect that he created                     of sense and judgement. For his part                     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;                     so it was not in any measure,                     the morning after, a surprise                     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.                     His visitor from the beginning                     broke greetings off, and gave Eugene                     a note from Lensky; in between                     Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.                     Onegin without more ado                     crossed to the window, read it through.                         IX                      Pleasant, in spite of its compression,                     gentlemanly, quite precise,                     Vladimir's challenge found expression                     that, though polite, was clear as ice.                     Eugene's response was automatic;                     he informed this envoy diplomatic                     in terms where not a word was spared:                     at any time he'd be prepared.                     Zaretsky rose without discussion;                     he saw no point in staying on,                     with work at home; but when he'd gone,                     Evgeny, whom the repercussion                     left quite alone with his own soul,                     was far from happy with his role.                     {159}                         X                      With reason, too: for when he'd vetted                     in secret judgement what he'd done,                     he found too much that he regretted:                     last night he'd erred in making fun,                     so heartless and so detrimental,                     of love so timorous and gentle.                     In second place the poet might                     have been a fool; yet he'd a right,                     at eighteen years, to some compassion.                     Evgeny loved him from his heart,                     and should have played a different part:                     no softball for the winds of fashion,                     no boy, to fight or take offence --                     the man of honour and of sense.                         XI                      He could have spoken without harming,                     need not have bristled like a beast;                     he should have settled for disarming                     that youthful heart. ``But now at least                     it's late, time's passing... not to mention,                     in our affair, the intervention                     of that old duellistic fox,                     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...                     True, scorn should punish and should bridle                     his wit, according to the rules                     but whispers, the guffaw of fools...''                     Public opinion -- here's our idol,                     the spring of honour, and the pin                     on which the world is doomed to spin.                     {160}                         XII                      Lensky at home awaits the answer,                     impatient, hatred flaming high;                     but here comes our loud-talking prancer                     who swaggers in with the reply.                     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!                     knowing the offender, he'd been frightened                     lest he should by some clever trick                     avert his chest from pistol's click,                     smoothe his way out with humour's ointment.                     But now Vladimir's doubts are still:                     early tomorrow at the mill                     before first light they have appointment,                     to raise the safety catch and strain                     to hit the target: thigh or brain.                         XIII                      Still blazing with resentment's fuel,                     and set on hating the coquette,                     Lensky resolved before the duel                     not to see Olga; in a fret                     watched sun and clock -- then by such labours                     defeated, turned up at his neighbour's.                     He thought that Olga'd be confused,                     struck down as if she'd been accused,                     when he arrived; not in the slightest:                     just as she'd always been, she tripped                     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped                     down from the porch, light as the lightest,                     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,                     the same as any other day.                     {161}                         XIV                      ``Last night, what made you fly so early?''                     was the first thing that Olga said.                     All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,                     and silently he hung his head.                     Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,                     before such candour of expression,                     such frank tendresse; away they stole                     before such playfulness of soul!...                     he looks, in sweet irresolution,                     and then concludes: she loves him yet!                     Already borne down by regret,                     he almost begs for absolution,                     he trembles, knows not what to tell;                     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...                         (XV, XVI,2) XVII                      Now brooding thoughts hold his attention                     once more, at that beloved sight,                     and so he lacks the strength to mention                     the happenings of the previous night;                     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;                     I'll stop that tempter from depraving                     her youth with all his repertoire                     of sighs, and compliments, and fire;                     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,                     shall not attack my lily's root;                     I'll save this blossom on the shoot,                     still hardly opened up, from fading.''                     Friends, all this meant was: I've a date                     for swapping bullets with my mate.                     {162}                         XVIII                      If only Lensky'd known the burning                     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!                     If Tanya'd had the chance of learning                     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,                     would settle, on the morrow morning,                     for which of them the tomb was yawning,                     perhaps her love could in the end                     have reunited friend to friend!                     But, even by accident, her passion                     was undiscovered to that day.                     Onegin had no word to say;                     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:                     of the whole world, her nurse alone,                     if not slow-witted, might have known.                         XIX                      Lensky all evening, in distraction,                     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --                     the quintessential reaction                     of Muses' offspring; sitting down                     before the clavichord with knitted                     forehead, he strummed, his vision flitted                     to Olga's face, he whispered low                     ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,                     the hour was late. And now from aching                     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;                     parting with Olga made him think                     it was quite torn in half and breaking.                     She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''                     ``It's nothing.'' And away he flew.                     {163}                         XX                      Once home, he brought out and inspected                     his pistols, laid them in their case,                     undressed, by candlelight selected                     and opened Schiller... but the embrace                     of one sole thought holds him in keeping                     and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:                     Olga is there, he sees her stand                     in untold beauty close at hand.                     Vladimir shuts the book, for writing                     prepares himself; and then his verse,                     compact of amorous trash, and worse,                     flows and reverberates. Reciting,                     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,                     like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.                         XXI                      By chance those verses haven't vanished;                     I keep them, and will quote them here:                     ``Whither, oh whither are ye banished,                     my golden days when spring was dear?                     What fate is my tomorrow brewing?                     the answer's past all human viewing,                     it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.                     No matter; fate's decree is just.                     Whether the arrow has my number,                     whether it goes careering past,                     all's well; the destined hour at last                     comes for awakening, comes for slumber;                     blessed are daytime's care and cark,                     blest is the advent of the dark!                     {164}                         XXII                      ``The morning star will soon be shining,                     and soon will day's bright tune be played;                     but I perhaps will be declining                     into the tomb's mysterious shade;                     the trail the youthful poet followed                     by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,                     and I be by the world forgot;                     but, lovely maiden, wilt thou not                     on my untimely urn be weeping,                     thinking: he loved me, and in strife                     the sad beginnings of his life                     he consecrated to my keeping?...                     Friend of my heart, be at my side,                     beloved friend, thou art my bride!''                         XXIII                      So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply                     (in the romantic style, we say,                     though what's romantic here I simply                     fail to perceive -- that's by the way).                     At last, with dawn upon him, stooping                     his weary head, and softly drooping                     over the modish word ideal,                     he dozed away; but when the real                     magic of sleep had started claiming                     its due oblivion, in the hush                     his neighbour entered at a rush                     and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:                     ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,                     Onegin's waiting on the ground.''                     {165}                         XXIV                      But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying                     and sleeping sounder than a rock.                     By now the shades of night are flying,                     Vesper is met by crow of cock --                     Onegin still is slumbering deeply.                     By now the sun is climbing steeply,                     and little dancing whirls of snow                     glitter and tumble as they go,                     but Eugene hasn't moved; for certain                     slumber still floats above his head.                     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,                     and parts the fringes of his curtain;                     he looks, and sees the hour of day --                     high time he should be on his way.                         XXV                      He rings at once, and what a scurry!                     his French valet, Guillot, is there                     with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,                     as linen's brought for him to wear.                     And while with all despatch he's dressing                     he warns his man for duty, stressing                     that with him to the trysting-place                     he has to bring the battle-case.                     By now the sledge is at the portal --                     he's racing millward like a bird.                     Arrived apace, he gives the word                     to bring across Lepage's4 mortal                     barrels, and then to drive aside                     by two small oaktrees in a ride.                     {166}                         XXVI                      While Lensky'd long been meditating                     impatiently on the mill-dam,                     Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,                     condemned the millstones as a sham.                     Onegin comes, and makes excuses;                     but in Zaretsky he induces                     amazement: ``Where's your second gone?''                     In duels a pedantic don,                     methodical by disposition,                     a classicist, he'll not allow                     that one be shot just anyhow --                     only by rule, and strict tradition                     inherited from earlier days                     (for which he must receive due praise).                         XXVII                      Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?                     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.                     I had most surely never reckoned                     his choice could shock or might offend;                     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion                     that he's not honest past all question.''                     Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene                     asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''                     Vladimir to this casual mention                     replies: ``We might as well.'' They walk                     behind the mill. In solemn talk,                     Zaretsky draws up a convention                     with Guillot; while pourparlers last                     the two foes stand with eyes downcast.                     {167}                         XXVIII                      Foes! Is it long since from each other                     the lust for blood drew them apart?                     long since, like brother linked to brother,                     they shared their days in deed and heart,                     their table, and their hours of leisure?                     But now, in this vindictive pleasure                     hereditary foes they seem,                     and as in some appalling dream                     each coldly plans the other's slaughter...                     could they not laugh out loud, before                     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,                     could they not give each other quarter                     and part in kindness? Just the same,                     all modish foes dread worldly shame.                         XXIX                      Pistols are out, they gleam, the hammer                     thumps as the balls are pressed inside                     faceted muzzles by the rammer;                     with a first click, the catch is tried.                     Now powder's greyish stream is slipping                     into the pan. Securely gripping,                     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.                     Guillot, behind a stump in view,                     stands in dismay and indecision.                     And now the two opponents doff                     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off                     thirty-two steps with great precision,                     and on their marks has made them stand;                     each grips his pistol in his hand.                     {168}                         XXX                      ``Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking                     to aim, at steady, even pace                     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,                     each took four steps across the space,                     four fateful stairs. Then, without slowing                     the level tenor of his going,                     Evgeny quietly began                     to lift his pistol up. A span                     of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,                     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --                     but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...                     The clock of doom had struck as fated;                     and the poet, without a sound,                     let fall his pistol on the ground.                         XXXI                      Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding                     to heart. And in his misted gaze                     is death, not pain. So gently gliding                     down slopes of mountains, when a blaze                     of sunlight makes it flash and crumble,                     a block of snow will slip and tumble.                     Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,                     darts to the boy, and looks, and still                     calls out his name... All unavailing:                     the youthful votary of rhyme                     has found an end before his time.                     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,                     the bloom has withered on the bough;                     the altar flame's extinguished now.                     {169}                         XXXII                      He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming                     was that calm brow of one who swooned.                     Shot through below the chest -- and streaming                     the blood came smoking from the wound.                     A moment earlier, inspiration                     had filled this heart, and detestation                     and hope and passion; life had glowed                     and blood had bubbled as it flowed;                     but now the mansion is forsaken;                     shutters are up, and all is pale                     and still within, behind the veil                     of chalk the window-panes have taken.                     The lady of the house has fled.                     Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.                         XXXIII                      With a sharp epigram it's pleasant                     to infuriate a clumsy foe;                     and, as observer, to be present                     and watch him stubbornly bring low                     his thrusting horns, and as he passes                     blush to descry in looking-glasses                     his foolish face; more pleasant yet                     to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get                     more joy still when with mute insistence                     you help him to an honoured fate                     by calmly aiming at his pate                     from any gentlemanly distance;                     but when you've managed his despatch                     you won't find that quite so much catch...                     {170}                         XXXIV                      What if your pistol-shot has smitten                     a friend of yours in his first youth                     because some glance of his has bitten                     your pride, some answer, or in truth                     some nonsense thrown up while carousing,                     or if himself, with rage arousing,                     he's called you out -- say, in your soul                     what feelings would assume control                     if, motionless, no life appearing,                     death on his brow, your friend should lie,                     stiffening as the hours go by,                     before you on the ground, unhearing,                     unspeaking, too, but stretched out there                     deaf to the voice of your despair?                         XXXV                      Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,                     Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled                     at heart by grim remorse's freezing.                     ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''                     Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,                     Onegin turns, and with a shiver                     summons his people. On the sleigh                     with care Zaretsky stows away                     the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing                     vanishes with his load of dread.                     The horses, as they sense the dead,                     have snorted, reared, and whitely foaming                     have drenched the steel bit as they go                     and flown like arrows from a bow.                     {171}                         XXXVI                      My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:                     right in the flower of joyous hope,                     hope that he's had no time to fashion                     for men to see, still in the scope                     of swaddling clothes -- already blighted!                     Where is the fire that once ignited,                     where's the high aim, the ardent sense                     of youth, so tender, so intense?                     and where is love's tempestuous yearning,                     where are the reveries this time,                     the horror of disgrace and crime,                     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,                     and life celestial's phantom gleams,                     stuff of the poet's hallowed dreams!                         XXXVII                      Perhaps to improve the world's condition,                     perhaps for fame, he was endowed;                     his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission                     might have resounded long and loud                     for aeons. Maybe it was fated                     that on the world's staircase there waited                     for him a lofty stair. His shade,                     after the martyr's price it paid,                     maybe bore off with it for ever                     a secret truth, and at our cost                     a life-creating voice was lost;                     to it the people's blessing never                     will reach, and past the tomb's compound                     hymns of the ages never sound.                     {172}                         (XXXVIII,2) XXXIX                      Perhaps however, to be truthful,                     he would have found a normal fate.                     The years would pass; no longer youthful,                     he'd see his soul cool in its grate;                     his nature would be changed and steadied,                     he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;                     and in the country, blissful, horned,                     in quilted dressing-gown adorned,                     life's real meaning would have found him;                     at forty he'd have got the gout,                     drunk, eaten, yawned, grown weak and stout,                     at length, midst children swarming round him,                     midst crones with endless tears to shed,                     and doctors, he'd have died in bed.                         XL                      Reader, whatever fate's direction,                     we weep for the young lover's end,                     the man of reverie and reflection,                     the poet struck down by his friend!                     Left-handed from the habitation                     where dwelt this child of inspiration,                     two pines have tangled at the root;                     beneath, a brook rolls its tribute                     toward the neighbouring valley's river.                     The ploughman there delights to doze,                     girl reapers as the streamlet flows                     dip in their jugs; where shadows quiver                     darkly above the water's lilt,                     a simple monument is built.                     {173}                         XLI                      Below it, when sprang rains are swishing,                     when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,                     the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing                     and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;                     and the young city-bred newcomer,                     who in the country spends her summer,                     when galloping at headlong pace                     alone across the fields of space,                     will halt her horse and, gripping tightly                     the leather rein, to learn the tale,                     lift up the gauzes of her veil,                     with a quick look perusing lightly                     the simple legend -- then a haze                     of tears will cloud her tender gaze.

All in good time, on each point I                     will give you a complete reply.                     {174}                         XLIII                      But not today. Although I dearly                     value the hero of my tale,                     though I'll come back to him, yet clearly                     to face him now I feel too frail...                     The years incline to gloom and prosing,                     they kill the zest of rhymed composing,                     and with a sigh I now admit                     I have to drag my feet to it.                     My pen, as once, no longer hurries                     to spoil loose paper by the ream;                     another, a more chilling dream,                     and other, more exacting worries,                     in fashion's din, at still of night,                     come to disturb me and affright.                         XLIV                      I've learnt the voice of new ambition,                     I've learnt new sadness; but in this                     the first will never find fruition,                     the earlier griefs are what I miss.                     O dreams, o dreams, where is your sweetness?                     where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?                     can it be true, their crown at last                     has felt time's desiccating blast?                     can it be true, and firmly stated                     without an elegiac frill,                     that spring with me has had its fill                     (as I've so oft in jest related)?                     Can it be true, it won't come twice --                     and I'll be thirty in a trice?                     {175}                         XLV                      Well, I must make a frank confession,                     my noon is here, and that's the truth.                     So let me with a kind expression                     take leave of my lightheaded youth!                     Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,                     thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,                     thank you for suffering and its joys,                     for tempests and for feasts and noise;                     thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow                     and in flat calm I've found the stuff                     of perfect bliss in you. Enough!                     My soul's like crystal, and tomorrow                     I shall set out on brand-new ways                     and rest myself from earlier days.                         XLVI                      Let me look back. Farewell, umbrageous                     forests where my young age was passed                     in indolence and in rampageous                     passion and dreams of pensive cast.                     But come, thou youthful inspiration,                     come, trouble my imagination,                     liven the drowsing of my heart,                     fly to my corner like a dart,                     let not the poet's soul of passion                     grow cold, and hard, and stiff as stock,                     and finally be turned to rock                     amid the deadening joys of fashion,                     < amongst the soulless men of pride,                     the fools who sparkle far and wide,6                     {176}                         XLVII                      amongst the crafty and small-minded,                     the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues                     both dull and ludicrous, the bunded                     critics and their capricious vogues,                     amongst devout coquettes, appalling                     lickspittles who adore their crawling,                     and daily scenes of modish life                     where civil treacheries are rife,                     urbane betrayals, and the chilling                     verdicts of vanity the bleak,                     men's thoughts, their plots, the words they speak,                     all of an emptiness so killing -- >                     that's the morass, I beg you note,                     in which, dear friends, we're all afloat!

Smiling through sleep, nature is meeting                          the infant year with cheerful greeting:                          the sky is brilliant in its blue                          and, still transparent to the view,                          the downy woods are greener-tinted;                          from waxen cell the bees again                          levy their tribute on the plain;                          the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;                          cows low, in the still nights of spring                          the nightingale's begun to sing.                          {178}                              II                           O spring! o time for love! how sadly                          your advent swamps me in its flood!                          and in my soul, o spring, how madly                          your presence aches, and in my blood!                          How heavy, and how near to sobbing,                          the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,                          caressing breath has fanned my face                          in rural calm's most secret place!

III                           Or, unconsoled by the returning                          of leaves that autumn killed for good,                          are we recalled to grief still burning                          by the new whisper in the wood?                          or else does nature, fresh and staring,                          set off our troubled mind comparing                          its newness with our faded days,                          with years no more to meet our gaze?                          Perhaps, when thoughts are all a-quiver                          in midst of a poetic dream,                          some other, older spring will gleam,                          and put our heart into a shiver                          with visions of enchanted night,                          of distant countries, of moonlight...                          {179}                              IV                           It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,                          dons of Epicurean rule,                          calm men with beatific features,                          graduates of the Levshin1 school,                          Priam-like agricultural sages,                          sensitive ladies of all ages --                          the spring invites you to the land                          now warmth and blossom are on hand,                          field-work, and walks with inspiration,                          and magic nights. In headlong course                          come to the fields, my friends! To horse!

V                           Forsake, indulgent reader -- driven                          in your calèche of foreign cast --                          the untiring city, where you've given                          to feasts and fun this winter past;                          and though my muse may be capricious,                          we'll go with her to that delicious                          and nameless rivulet, that scene                          of whispering woods where my Eugene,                          an idle monk in glum seclusion,                          has lately wintered, just a space                          from young Tatyana's dwelling-place,                          dear Tanya, lover of illusion;                          though there he's no more to be found,                          he's left sad footprints on the ground.                          {180}                              VI                           Amidst the hills, down in that valley,                          let's go where, winding all the time                          across green meadows, dilly-dally,                          a brook flows through a grove of lime.                          There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,                          the wild rose blooms, and in the covert                          the source's chattering voice is heard;                          and there a tombstone says its word                          where two old pinetrees stand united:                          ``This is Vladimir Lensky's grave                          who early died as die the brave'' --                          the headpiece-text is thus indited --                          the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,                          young poet, be for ever blest!''                              VII                           There was a pine-branch downward straying                          towards the simple urn beneath;                          time was when morning's breeze was swaying                          over it a mysterious wreath:                          time was, in evening hours of leisure,                          by moonlight two young girls took pleasure,                          closely embraced, in wending here,                          to see the grave, and shed a tear.                          Today... the sad memorial's lonely,                          forgot. Its trodden path is now                          choked up. There's no wreath on the bough;                          grey-haired and weak, beneath it only                          the shepherd, as he used to do,                          sings as he plaits a humble shoe.                          {181}                              (VIII,2 IX,) X                           Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,                          or pining, Olga's hours were brief.                          Alas for him! there was no keeping                          his sweetheart faithful to her grief.                          Another had the skill to ravish                          her thoughts away, knew how to lavish                          sweet words by which her pain was banned --                          a Lancer wooed and won her hand,                          a Lancer -- how she deified him!                          and at the altar, with a crown,                          her head in modesty cast down,                          already there she stands beside him;                          her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,                          and on her lips a light smile plays.                              XI                           Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded                          by dull eternity's purlieus,                          was the sad poet not confounded                          at this betrayal's fateful news?                          Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,                          perhaps no more sensations lumbered                          the lucky bard, and as he dozed                          the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...                          On such indifference, such forgetting                          beyond the grave we all must build --                          foes, friends and loves, their voice is stilled.                          Only the estate provides a setting                          for angry heirs, as one, to fall                          into an unbecoming brawl.                          {182}                              XII                           Presently Olga's ringing answer                          inside the Larins' house fell mute.                          Back to his regiment the Lancer,                          slave of the service, was en route.                          Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,                          the old dame wept her daughter's parting,                          and in her grief seemed fit to die;                          but Tanya found she couldn't cry:                          only the pallor of heart-breaking                          covered her face. When all came out                          onto the porch, and fussed about                          over the business of leave-taking,                          Tatyana went with them, and sped                          the carriage of the newly-wed.                              XIII                           And long, as if through mists that spurted,                          Tanya pursued them with her gaze...                          So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!                          The comrade of so many days,                          oh! her young dove, the natural hearer                          of secrets, like a friend but dearer,                          had been for ever borne off far                          and parted from her by their star.                          Shade-like, in purposeless obsession                          she roams the empty garden-plot...                          in everything she sees there's not                          a grain of gladness; tears' repression                          allows no comfort to come through --                          Tatyana's heart is rent in two.                          {183}                              XIV                           Her passion burns with stronger powder                          now she's bereft, and just the same                          her heart speaks to her even louder                          of far-away Onegin's name.                          She'll not see him, her obligation                          must be to hold in detestation                          the man who laid her brother low.                          The poet's dead... already though                          no one recalls him or his verses;                          by now his bride-to-be has wed                          another, and his memory's fled                          as smoke in azure sky disperses.                          Two hearts there are perhaps that keep                          a tear for him... but what's to weep?                              XV                           Evening, and darkening sky, and waters                          in quiet flood. A beetle whirred.                          The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.                          Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred                          a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming                          silver with moonlight, in her dreaming                          profoundly sunk, Tatyana stalked                          for hours alone; she walked and walked...                          Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted                          a house, a village, and a wood                          below a hill; a garden stood                          above a stream the moon had lighted.                          She looked across, felt in her heart                          a faster, stronger pulsing start.                          {184}                              XVI                           She hesitates, and doubts beset her:                          forward or back? it's true that he                          has left, and no one here has met her...                          ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''                          So down came Tanya, hardly daring                          to draw a breath, around her staring                          with puzzled and confused regard...                          She entered the deserted yard.                          Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...                          Her frightened cry brought running out                          the household boys in noisy rout;                          giving the lady their protection,                          by dint of cuff and kick and smack                          they managed to disperse the pack.                              XVII                           ``Could I just see the house, I wonder?''                          Tatyana asked. The children all                          rushed to Anisia's room, to plunder                          the keys that opened up the hall.                          At once Anisia came to greet her,                          the doorway opened wide to meet her,                          she went inside the empty shell                          in which our hero used to dwell.                          She looks: forgotten past all chalking                          on billiard-table rests a cue,                          and on the crumpled sofa too                          a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...                          ``And here's the hearth,'' explains the crone,                          ``where master used to sit alone.                          {185}                              XVIII                           ``Here in the winter he'd have dinner                          with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.                          Please follow me. And here's the inner                          study where he would sleep and feast                          on cups of coffee, and then later                          he'd listen to the administrator;                          in morning time he'd read a book...                          And just here, in the window-nook,                          is where old master took up station,                          and put his glasses on to see                          his Sunday game of cards with me.                          I pray God grant his soul salvation,                          and rest his dear bones in the tomb,                          down in our damp earth-mother's womb!''                              XIX                           Tatyana in a deep emotion                          gazes at all the scene around;                          she drinks it like a priceless potion;                          it stirs her drooping soul to bound                          in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:                          that table where the lamp has languished,                          beside the window-sill, that bed                          on which a carpet has been spread,                          piled books, and through the pane the sable                          moonscape, the half-light overall,                          Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,                          the iron figure3 on the table,                          the hat, the scowling brow, the chest                          where folded arms are tightly pressed.                          {186}                              XX                           Longtime inside this modish cloister,                          as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.                          It's late. A breeze begins to roister,                          the valley's dark. The forest lands                          round the dim river sleep; the curtain                          of hills has hid the moon; for certain                          the time to go has long since passed                          for the young pilgrim. So at last                          Tatyana, hiding her condition,                          and not without a sigh, perforce                          sets out upon her homeward course;                          before she goes, she seeks permission                          to come back to the hall alone                          and read the books there on her own.                              XXI                           Outside the gate Tatyana parted                          with old Anisia. The next day                          at earliest morning out she started,                          to the empty homestead made her way,                          then in the study's quiet setting,                          at last alone, and quite forgetting                          the world and all its works, she wept                          and sat there as the minutes crept;                          the books then underwent inspection...                          at first she had no heart to range;                          but then she found their choice was strange.                          To reading from this odd collection                          Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:                          and watched a different world unroll.                          {187}                              XXII                           Though long since Eugene's disapproval                          had ruled out reading, in their place                          and still exempted from removal                          a few books had escaped disgrace:                          Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,                          two or three novels where our later                          epoch's portrayed, survived the ban,                          works where contemporary man                          is represented rather truly,                          that soul without a moral tie,                          all egoistical and dry,                          to dreaming given up unduly,                          and that embittered mind which boils                          in empty deeds and futile toils.                              XXIII                           There many pages keep the impression                          where a sharp nail has made a dent.                          On these, with something like obsession,                          the girl's attentive eyes are bent.                          Tatyana sees with trepidation                          what kind of thought, what observation,                          had drawn Eugene's especial heed                          and where he'd silently agreed.                          Her eyes along the margin flitting                          pursue his pencil. Everywhere                          Onegin's soul encountered there                          declares itself in ways unwitting --                          terse words or crosses in the book,                          or else a query's wondering hook.                          {188}                              XXIV                           And so, at last, feature by feature,                          Tanya begins to understand                          more thoroughly, thank God, the creature                          for whom her passion has been planned                          by fate's decree: this freakish stranger,                          who walks with sorrow, and with danger,                          whether from heaven or from hell,                          this angel, this proud devil, tell,                          what is he? Just an apparition,                          a shadow, null and meaningless,                          a Muscovite in Harold's dress,                          a modish second-hand edition,                          a glossary of smart argot...                          a parodistic raree-show?                              XXV                           Can she have found the enigma's setting?                          is this the riddle's missing clue?                          Time races, and she's been forgetting                          her journey home is overdue.                          Some neighbours there have come together;                          they talk of her, of how and whether:                          ``Tanya's no child -- it's past a joke,''                          says the old lady in a croak:                          ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.                          It's time she went. But what can I                          do with her when a flat reply                          always comes back: I'll not be wedded.                          And then she broods and mopes for good,                          and trails alone around the wood.''                          {189}                              XXVI                           ``She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.                          Buyánov tried -- got flea in ear.                          And Ivan Petushkóv; no, never.                          Pikhtín, of the Hussars, was here;                          he found Tatyana so attractive,                          bestirred himself, was devilish active!                          I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;                          far from it! just one more collapse.''                          ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:                          Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!                          There's vacancies in plenty there.''                          ``My dear good sir, I'm short of money.''                          ``One winter's worth, you've surely got;                          or borrow, say, from me, if not.''                              XXVII                           The old dame had no thought of scouring                          such good and sensible advice;                          accounts were done, a winter outing                          to Moscow settled in a trice.                          Then Tanya hears of the decision.                          To face society's derision                          with the unmistakeable sideview                          of a provincial ingénue,                          to expose to Moscow fops and Circes                          her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,                          parade before their mocking gaze                          her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!                          no, forests are the sole retreat                          where her security's complete.                          {190}                              XXVIII                           Risen with earliest rays of dawning,                          Tanya today goes hurrying out                          into the fields, surveys the morning,                          with deep emotion looks about                          and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!                          farewell you too, familiar mountains!                          Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,                          beauty with all its heavenly spell,                          gay nature and its sparkling distance!                          This dear, still world I must forswear                          for vanity, and din, and glare!...                          Farewell to you, my free existence!                          whither does all my yearning tend?                          my fate, it leads me to what end?''                              XXIX                           She wanders on without direction.                          Often she halts against her will,                          arrested by the sheer perfection                          she finds in river and in hill.                          As with old friends, she craves diversion                          in gossip's rambling and discursion                          with her own forests and her meads...                          But the swift summer-time proceeds --                          now golden autumn's just arriving.                          Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect                          suggests a victim richly decked...                          The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --                          amidst the howling and the blast                          sorceress-winter's here at last.                          {191}                              XXX                           She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples                          the branches of the oak with flock;                          lies in a coverlet that ripples                          across the fields, round hill and rock;                          the bank, the immobile stream are levelled                          beneath a shroud that's all dishevelled;                          frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks                          old mother winter at her pranks.                          Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --                          for her, no joy from winter-time,                          she won't inhale the powdered rime,                          nor from the bath-house roof be clearing                          first snow for shoulders, breast and head:                          for Tanya, winter's ways are dread.                              XXXI                           Departure date's long overtaken;                          at last the final hours arrive.                          A sledded coach, for years forsaken,                          relined and strengthened for the drive;                          three carts -- traditional procession --                          with every sort of home possession:                          pans, mattresses, and trunks, and chairs,                          and jam in jars, and household wares,                          and feather-beds, and birds in cages,                          with pots and basins out of mind,                          and useful goods of every kind.                          There's din of parting now that rages,                          with tears, in quarters of the maids:                          and, in the yard, stand eighteen jades.                          {192}                              XXXII                           Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;                          the cooks prepare the midday meal;                          mountains are piled on every carriage,                          and coachmen swear, and women squeal.                          The bearded outrider is sitting                          his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,                          to wave farewell the household waits                          for the two ladies at the gates.                          They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,                          the grand barouche is on its way.                          ``Farewell, you realms that own the sway                          of solitude, and peace abiding!                          shall I see you?'' As Tanya speaks                          the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.                              XXXIII                           When progress and amelioration                          have pushed their frontiers further out,                          in time (to quote the calculation                          of philosophic brains, about                          five hundred years) for sure our byways                          will blossom into splendid highways:                          paved roads will traverse Russia's length                          bringing her unity and strength;                          and iron bridges will go arching                          over the waters in a sweep;                          mountains will part; below the deep,                          audacious tunnels will be marching:                          Godfearing folk will institute                          an inn at each stage of the route.                          {193}                              XXXIV                           But now our roads are bad, the ages                          have gnawed our bridges, and the flea                          and bedbug that infest the stages                          allow no rest to you or me;                          inns don't exist; but in a freezing                          log cabin a pretentious-teasing                          menu, hung up for show, excites                          all sorts of hopeless appetites;                          meanwhile the local Cyclops, aiming                          a Russian hammer-blow, repairs                          Europe's most finely chiselled wares                          before a fire too slowly flaming,                          and blesses the unrivalled brand                          of ruts that grace our fatherland.                              XXXV                           By contrast, in the frozen season,                          how pleasantly the stages pass.                          Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,                          the winter's ways are smooth as glass.                          Then our Automedons are flashing,                          our troikas effortlessly dashing,                          and mileposts grip the idle sense                          by flickering past us like a fence.                          Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment                          of her own horses, not the post,                          spared her the expense she dreaded most --                          and gave our heroine enjoyment                          of traveller's tedium at its peak:                          their journey took them a full week.                          {194}                              XXXVI                           But now they're near. Already gleaming                          before their eyes they see unfold                          the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming                          with fire from every cross of gold.                          Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure                          when suddenly I saw this treasure                          of spires and belfries, in a cup                          with parks and mansions, open up.                          How often would I fall to musing                          of Moscow in the mournful days                          of absence on my wandering ways!                          Moscow... how many strains are fusing                          in that one sound, for Russian hearts!                          what store of riches it imparts!                              XXXVII                           Here stands, with shady park surrounded,                          Petrovsky Castle; and the fame                          in which so lately it abounded                          rings proudly in that sombre name.                          Napoleon here, intoxicated                          with recent fortune, vainly waited                          till Moscow, meekly on its knees,                          gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:                          but no, my Moscow never stumbled                          nor crawled in suppliant attire.                          No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire                          the impatient conqueror was humbled!                          From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,                          he gazed out on the threatening glow.                          {195}                              XXXVIII                           Farewell, Petrovsky Castle, glimmer                          of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,                          drive on! And now we see a-shimmer                          the pillars of the turnpike-gate;                          along Tverskaya Street already                          the potholes make the coach unsteady.                          Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,                          boys, country women, stately halls,                          parks, monasteries, towers and ledges,                          Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,                          boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,                          peasants, and fashion-shops, and sledges,                          lions adorning gateway posts                          and, on the crosses, jackdaw hosts.                              (XXXIX,2) XL                           This wearisome perambulation                          takes up an hour or two; at last                          the coach has reached its destination;                          after Saint Chariton's gone past                          a mansion stands just round a turning.                          On an old aunt, who's long been burning                          with a consumption, they've relied.                          And now the door is opened wide,                          a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,                          bespectacled, in tattered dress;                          and from the salon the princess,                          stretched on a sofa, calls to greet them.                          The two old ladies kiss and cry;                          thickly the exclamations fly.                          {196}                              XLI                           ``Princess, mon ange!'' ``Pachette!'' ``Alina!''                          ``Who would have thought it?'' ``What an age!''                          ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest kuzina!''                          ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage                          or else a novel.'' ``And my daughter                          Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''                          ``Ah, Tanya, come to me, it seems                          I'm wandering in a world of dreams...

This world's so vacuous that it's got                          no spark of fun in all its rot!                          {200}                              XLIX                           In swarms around Tatyana ranging,                          the modish Record Office clerks                          stare hard at her before exchanging                          some disagreeable remarks.

Once Vyázemsky,4 who chanced to find her                          at some dull aunt's, sat down and knew                          how to engage in talk that drew                          her soul's attention; just behind her                          an old man saw her as she came,                          straightened his wig, and asked her name.

8	                          Days when I came to flower serenely                               in Lycée gardens long ago,                               and read my Apuleius keenly,                               but spared no glance for Cicero;                               yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying                               secluded vales, where swans were crying,                               by waters that were still and clear,                               for the first time the Muse came near.

Faces before him flash and change                               like irksome phantoms, null as zero.                               Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb                               torment of pride? And why's he come?                               Who on earth is he? not... our hero?                               No doubt about it, it's Eugene.                               ``How long has he been on the scene?                               {208}                                                            VIII                                                         Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?                               does he still pose, and play the freak?

For what charade is he apparelled?                               Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,                               a patriot, a cosmopolite,                               bigot or prude? or has he quite                               a different mask? is he becoming                               someone like you and me, just nice?

No, all in her was calm and plain.

How long he'd been here, was her query,                               and where had he arrived from, not                               from their own country? Then she shot                               across to her consort a weary                               regard, and slipped away for good, ...                               with Eugene frozen where he stood.                               {214}                                                            XX                                                         Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted                               in solitude, as at the start                               of this our novel we reported,                               in the far backwoods' deepest heart,                               to whom, in a fine flow of preaching,                               he had conveyed some moral teaching,                               from whom he'd kept a letter, where                               her heart had spoken, free as air,                               untouched by trace of inhibition,                               could it be she... or had he dreamed?                               the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed                               the modesty of her condition,                               could it be she, who just had turned                               away, so cool, so unconcerned?                                                            XXI                                                         Eugene forsakes the packed reception,                               and home he drives, deep-sunk in thought.                               By dreams now sad in their conception,                               now sweet, his slumbers are distraught.                               He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?                               Prince N. respectfully invites him                               to a soirée. ``My God! to her!...                               I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir                               a swift, polite reply is written.                               What ails him? he's in some strange daze!                               what moves along the hidden ways                               in one so slothful, so hard-bitten?                               vexation? vainness? heavens above,                               it can't be youth's distemper -- love?                               {215}                                                            XXII                                                         Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,                               once more he can't await the night;                               now ten has struck, his wheels are rolling,                               he drives there like a bird in flight,                               he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver                               led to the princess, all a-shiver,                               finds her alone, and there they sit                               some minutes long. The words won't fit                               on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,                               his awkwardness, he's hardly said                               a single thing to her. His head                               is lost in obstinate reflection;                               and obstinate his look. But she                               sits imperturbable, and free.

They laugh. The guests begin arriving.                               Already now the talk was thriving                               on modish malice, coarse of grain                               but salt; near the princess a vein                               of unaffectedly fantastic                               invention sparkled, then gave way                               to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,                               no deathless truths, nothing scholastic;                               and no one's ear could take offence                               at such vivacious, free good sense.                               {216}                                                            XXIV                                                         High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,                               Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --                               the inevitable silly asses,                               the faces met with everywhere;                               ladies of riper years, delicious                               in rose-trimmed bonnets, but malicious;                               a girl or two, without a smile                               to crack between them; for a while                               one listened to a chief of mission                               on state affairs; there was a wit,                               a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,                               a joker in the old tradition,                               acute and subtle -- in a word                               all that today we find absurd.

In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,                               ripen, and find a new expression --                               the vital force gives them the shoot                               of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit.

Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:                               she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;                               Onegin wastes, you'd almost find                               he's got consumption. In his anguish                               some vote a doctor for the case,                               others prescribe a watering-place.                               {220}                                                            XXXII                                                         But go he won't: for him, a letter                               fixing an early rendezvous                               with his forefathers would seem better;                               but she (for women, that's not new)                               remains unmoved: still he's persistent,                               active, and hopeful, and insistent:                               his illness lends him courage and                               to the princess, in his weak hand,                               he sends a letter, penned with passion.                               He deemed, in general, letters vain,                               and rightly so, but now his pain                               had gone in no uncertain fashion                               past all endurance. You're referred                               to Eugene's letter, word for word.                               {221}                                                            Onegin's Letter to Tatyana                                                         ``I know it all: my secret ache                               will anger you in its confession.

No look, no word for him: she's chosen                               to encase herself inside a layer                               of Twelfth Night's chillest, iciest air.

Though his eyes were reading,                               his thoughts were on a distant goal:                               desires and dreams and griefs were breeding                               and swarming in his inmost soul.                               Between the lines of text as printed,                               his mind's eye focused on the hinted                               purport of other lines; intense                               was his absorption in their sense.

He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping                               motionless as one soundly sleeping                               in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;                               he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''                               And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,                               a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,                               young traitresses by the platoon,                               comrades despised, and comrades rotten;                               a country house -- and one who still                               sits there beside the window-sill!

His conversion                               would have been all that we required!                               It's true, the magnet-like attraction                               of Russian verse, its force in action, --                               my inept pupil, at that hour,                               so nearly had them in his power.                               Who could have looked the poet better,                               as in the nook he'd sit alone                               by blazing fireplace, and intone                               Idol mio or Benedetta,                               and on the flames let fall unseen                               a slipper, or a magazine?                               {226}                                                            XXXIX                                                         The days flew past; by now the season                               in warmer airs was half dispersed.                               He's neither died, nor lost his reason,                               nor turned a poet. In the burst                               of spring he lives, he's energetic;                               he leaves one morning the hermetic                               apartment where a double glaze                               has kept him warm in chimney's blaze                               while, marmot-like, he hibernated --                               along the Neva in a sleigh,                               past ice-blocks, blue and squared away,                               he drives in brilliant sun; striated                               along the street lies dirty snow;                               and like an arrow from a bow                                                            XL                                                         over the slush, where is he chasing?                               You've guessed before it all began:                               to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,                               my strange, incorrigible man.                               He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...                               the hall's without a living creature,                               the big room, further, not a cat.                               He opens up a door. What's that                               that strikes him with such force and meaning?                               The princess, sitting peaked and wan,                               alone, with no adornment on;                               she holds a letter up, and leaning                               cheek upon hand she softly cries                               in a still stream that never dries.                               {227}                                                            XLI                                                         Who in that flash could not have reckoned                               her full account of voiceless pain?                               Who in the princess for that second                               would not have recognized again                               our hapless Tanya! An emotion                               of wild repentance and devotion                               threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,                               and looked at him without a word,                               without surprise or rage... his laden,                               his humbly suppliant approach,                               his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --                               she sees it all. The simple maiden,                               whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,                               in her once more has come alive.

What daze,                               what dream accounts for her distraction?                               A pause of silence and inaction,                               then quietly at last says she:                               ``Enough, stand up.

How many days                               since, through the mist that dreams arise on,                               young Tanya first appeared to me,                               Onegin too -- and there to see,                               a free romance's far horizon,                               still dim, through crystal's magic glass,                               before my gaze began to pass.                               {232}                                                            LI                                                         Of those who heard my opening pages                               in friendly gatherings where I read,                               as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,                               ``some are far distant, some are dead''.                               They've missed Eugene's completed etching.                               But she who modelled for the sketching                               of Tanya's image... Ah, how great                               the toll of those borne off by fate!                               Blest he who's left the hurly-burly                               of life's repast betimes, nor sought                               to drain its beaker down, nor thought                               of finishing its book, but early                               has wished it an abrupt goodbye --                               and, with my Eugene, so have I.
